    "In this project, we will be investigating how different database systems handle semi-structured JSON data. In particular, we will be placing emphasis on the use of MongoDB: a database system that stores data in a construct known as documents. These documents are very similar to the JSON objects we've explored in lecture with a few differences in representation and indexing that we will explore in the following questions. In this project, we will be working with the Yelp Academic Dataset which contains a dataset of `businesses`, `reviews`, and `users`. Due to the limitations of JupyterHub and the Mongo instances we are working with, `reviews` and `users` are truncated to 7500 reviews and 1000 users. We will be using the full `businesses` dataset, however.\n",

    "\n",
    "In lecture, we discussed how one could find specific attributes from a JSON object using dot notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "While you can still use the dot notation in queries, PyMongo represents documents returned from Mongo queries using Python dictionaries, making it convenient to manipulate JSON using a mix of Mongo queries and array indexing. Specifically, given the result of a retrieval `find` query, you can look up the third document by appending `[2]`. Then, given this document, you can look up the field `'amount'` by appending `['amount']` etc., adding multiple square brackets as needed to \"walk down\" the JSON tree representation via `collection.find(...)[2]['amount']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a visual output of the query results, you will need to wrap `collection.find(...)` inside `list()`, e.g. `list(collection.find(...))`. This is because `collection.find(...)` returns a **Cursor** object, which is an iterator. **An important consequence** is that if we set `result = collection.find(...)`, then calling `list(result)` for the first time will get you the expected list of documents in the query result, but calling `list(result)` for a second time will give you an empty list! So wrapping `collection.find(...)` directly inside `list()` would avoid this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another note - since we are using Python dictionaries as our query filter, make sure to wrap all keys and values inside quotes.\n",
    "\n",

    "Notice how cities like Portland and Atlanta, and Orlando are classified as California cities! However, the latitude and longitude is generally correct. The latitude of Colorado is between 37 and 41 **inclusive** and the longitude is between -109 and -102 **inclusive**. Now, use this to **find the average star rating** of all businesses in this range with **30 or more reviews**.\n",

    "Recall that in SQL, we would use a GROUP BY with the AVG aggregation function. In Mongo, we use an aggregation pipeline, comprised of multiple stages. Each stage transforms the documents in some way. Pipeline stages do not need to produce one output document for every input document. For example, some stages may generate new documents or filter out documents.\n",

    "**Hint 1**: as in the previous question, you may find it helpful to use the PyMongo array notation to extract the pertinent information once you have composed the right Mongo aggregation query. You are required to wrap `collection.aggregate(...)` inside `list()`, e.g. `list(collection.aggregate(...))` before indexing / visualizing the output. Similar to `collection.find(...)`, `collection.aggregate(...)` also returns a **Cursor** object (which is an iterator).\n",

    "For this question, we would like to create an aggregation pipeline to find the town in each state with the highest average number of stars. **We will only consider towns with greater than or equal to 5 reviews in total across all the restaurants in that town so that the average is meaningful.** Your final output should contain exactly two fields: `city_state` which is the name of the town with the highest value of average stars in the state concatenated with a comma followed by the state initials and `averageStars` which contains the average number of stars for the corresponding town. To ensure your output is consistent with the autograder, sort in descending order by `averageStars` and break ties by sorting second on `city_state` in alphabetical (ascending) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, imagine that Berkeley and Austin have the highest average stars in California and Texas respectively (and both have more than or equal to 5 total reviews). If Berkeley and Austin both have an average star rating of 5.0, your final output should be:\n",

       "  'text': \"First the entrance makes no sense.. Before you get to the hostess table, there's a room with tables and guests dining.\\n\\nThe waiter is pretty friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. He is a little heavy on trying to get some wine at the table, but this is expected with fine dining. He proceeds to get our drinks and informs us we will be getting bread soon. Comes back and takes our app order, bread still on the way.. Comes back with the appetizer and still no bread. I don't want the bread, but it's just poor management if you cannot bring bread to the table before apps. (Yes, I used to be a server)\\n\\nCalamari - It is delicious but it is not your typical calamari. It is served under an Asian slaw with no dipping sauce.\\nJumbo Crab Cake - This is definitely jumbo, and definitely crab. It is one large patty with a TON of crab. This was also very good and the roulade it is served with is not bad at all.\\nTempura Lobster Tail - This was good, and I am pretty sure they left it on the shell so we had no doubt that it was worth the 33 dollars. I would rather get the lobster boiled but the appetizer just came fried.\\n\\nPanko-Crusted Halibut - this was the special and the fish itself was fresh, but the flavoring was on the bland side and not enjoyable\\nBone-in Filet - asked for medium and got medium-well. It was dry and lacked flavor.\\nFilet - not bad, but was nothing to write home about. I can make this better with the right cut of meat.\\nAhi-Tuna - this definitely lacked flavor, but then again the person who got it wanted it to be medium. If it is sushi grade tuna I would do medium-rare or on the rare side. I won't dock points because of flavor.\\n\\nI expected way more from a fine steakhouse.. They had great appetizers but bad entrees. Step up your game please.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I love massages, good massages that is. And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! \\n\\nI think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.\\nI tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.\\nI had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.\\nBut the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.\\nThis was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.\\nI literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.\\n\\nOn a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. \\nThis place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself. They literally have employment ads on Craigslist every day!!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Service was awful food bad and poor quality.  Dirty, messy table, greedy female server trying to push higher cost menu items.  Went in around 1pm on a tuesday, based upon reviews, thought place was going to be packed, not one single table with paying customers, just 2 employees sitting at one of the multiple tables in the back partvof the restaurant, and 2 other people arranging tables and walking back and forth. Finally, after 5 minutes, the greedy server came around to take our drink order, some of us order iced water, some coke, and sprite, and my son order a lemonade, which after 3 minutes, she told us they where out of.  She offered him either a coke or sprite, which he rejected, and asked instead for a glass with iced water.  After 5 minutes, SURPRISE, he had a lemonade on the table, or at least looked as one, but no it was a flavorless glass of water with lots of sugar in it. Now, going to the food, dumplings were delicious, eggroll tasted like frozen food boxed one, sweet and sour pork was crappy, crispy beef was great, walnut shrimp was ok, about a B+, chowmein and fried rice were lousy, flavorless and warm, not hot as they should.  When the check came, I don't understand why they impose you a 18-20% tip already included on your bill.  I don't know if you agree with me, but why should you tip that much for service that was bad, and when the server doesn't do a good job according to your expectations and in turn tries to push items that increase your check, so that she can pump up her 20% tip that she didn't deserve.  Tips are deserved with the quality of your service: terrible service = no tip, bad service = no more than 10%, ok service = upto 15%, great service = 18% up to no limit.  Again, tips are worked for, not imposed.  \\nDo not waste your time here, look for a better option if craving Chinese or try some other type of food.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Lucky Plus is a Hong Kong-style cafe restaurant.  I think they recently opened as there were still many bouquet signs in front when I visited with my family.  \\n\\nThe menu seems to have a wide variety of foods from the simple rice and noodle dishes to the more elaborate like braise lamb hot pot.  The ambience seem nice with the tasteful decor, with good comfortable seating that is not too crowded.  \\n\\nBut that's where the good side ends.  Our server seemed very rushed to take our order after we sat down (at 11am just when they opened).  She came to our table 3 times in a short span of 5 minutes.  We did not realize why until we placed our order for a couple of appetizer dishes (Hand shredded chicken and 7-flavor deep fried squid) and a couple of entree dishes (Fried noodles with chicken, Mapo tofu rice, Sauteed shrimp).  It took almost 35 minutes until our first dish showed up which seem an eternity when one is hungry for brunch.  \\n\\nWhen the food dishes showed up at last, we were very disappointed at every dish.  The hand shredded chicken was more of cut-up pieces of chicken with little taste and too many pieces of skin thrown in.  The 7-flavour deep-fried squid tasted bland -- I tasted salty which is just one flavour as I tried to find more flavour.  The fried noodles looked good but lacked anything special (including taste!).  The sauteed shrimps were not well de-veined so tasted bitter.  We all thought what could possibly go wrong with mapo tofu rice?  Well, the mapo sauce was definitely from a jar so that was pretty hard to mess up, but the rice was too hard (tasted like rice left in a refrigerator overnight).  Very disappointed at the food at Lucky Plus!  \\n\\nTo add to the poor service and bad quality food, we were presented with the same dishes we had already eaten 3 times over!  If the food quality was better we might have taken up their offer!  But we were honestly not interested in more of the same bad dishes.  \\n\\nWe hope that Lucky Plus is just testing their kitchen process to make improvements and honing their waiting service to provide a more enjoyable experience for their customers.  But they will need to do this quickly as many traditional Chinese clients like myself would not likely go back after the one bad experience.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My husband and I have been pleased with hooters wings and had pretty decent service at the last hooters we went to. This one I must say was pretty bad. We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them. This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started. \\n\\nOur server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time. Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs. I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens, especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood.\\n\\nAfter we ordered our meal, it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook, I could understand. People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up. We finished our meal within 15 minutes and never heard from our server again.\\n\\nAfter waiting for the check for about 15 minutes, I figured she might have thought we were still eating...I'm not sure. So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table. We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check. This never happened. \\n\\nAfter another 15 minutes, I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around. The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about 10 minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next. This never happened.\\n\\nWithin the NEXT 15 minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours, then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us, there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him: Bending over real far to wipe the table, sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him, and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here 10 feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for 45 minutes now. After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay.\\n\\nShe ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back. I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys. I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them. What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock. Not acceptable. I've never given any server under 10% for service even if it was pretty bad until now. If I do decide to go back to Hooters it will not be for a very long time.\",\n",

After telling her that wasn't the case(she had given a margarita to the group of African American ladies 5-10ft to my right but not to me) she decided I had at some point walked away from the bar which was also not true(the people waiting on me thought I had left during this interlude).

It looked beautiful. However it was not true to its name but mostly whipped cream with a caramel sticky center that made it impossible to cut neatly. Did not know about the weird caramel center until I cut into it. Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.  If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving.  The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet. No one commented good or bad but silent speaks louder than words. :/ Will not order this particular cake again. Overpriced at $52 for 12 inch.',\n",

Poor set up to order (still the same) but good food but the flavorless flaw out lobster. \\n\\nThis time they are willing to run your credit/debit card to pay for the meal, the cashier said I could come back after eating to leave a tip. Still a bad set up. Ok THE FOOD now:\\n\\nOrdered Lobster roll and Whole belly fried claims with one of my sides being onion nuggets. 4 months had the nuggets, love them, it was a hunk of onion in the middle. Now I got small onion rings. I thought I got the wrong thing. But I was told nuggets are small rings and onion rings are big rings. So they changed. \\n\\nThe whole belly fried claims were great!!! Hard to find whole belly's. Yum!! \\n\\nThe sides are good the beans, potato salad, coleslaw. The small onion rings did taste good. \\n\\nMy lobster roll had no flavor!!!!!! Right color of lobster right texture of lobster. It was like eating air with just no flavor whatsoever. I grew up in Maine so this was A Big Disappointment. Had ice crystals in it. \\n\\nThey did take it off the bill since I had only two bits. So they handled it good. \\n\\nThey need to change the way you order. If they did, they could add more tables. \\nTables turned equal $$$ for the compant\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Banzai was the first place I ever had sushi in Austin, and it's truly a-okay. Let me say, though, that when I come here now, I don't come here for the sushi. I'll say right off that bat- don't have the rolls. Even for the price, they are not worth it. They are obviously pre-made and refrigerated, and they're probably not what you're in the mood for anyway (you won't find anything fresh-made, nothing hot, nothing deep-fried, nothing fusion- just the basic regulars, pre-made and retrieved from the fridge when you order it). Back when I first started coming to Banzai I only ate nigiri, so I didn't know how bad the rolls were. Don't get me wrong, they won't give you food poisoning or anything- they're just not good. The nigiri, though, is decent, if a bit over-priced for the portions. It's great for a quick bite though- the service is decent and fast and the servers are friendly. I also LOVE their bento boxes- they're a really good deal and delicious, especially the salmon one. You can also get an assortment of those Japanese fad drinks, which I like because you can't get those at most other sushi places. The tonkatsu is also good- with pork the way I like it, as opposed to with chicken the way it's offered at almost every other Japanese place in Austin. The lunch specials are okay- they give me the same pre-made and thawed impression I get from the rolls, but they aren't bad tasting, although the portions are a little small. Overall the place is decent. Not worth going out of your way for, but if you know to avoid the rolls you won't leave unhappy.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Tiffins is an upscale restaurant located in the middle of Disney's Animal Kingdom.  We were excited to eat here before trying to catch the Rivers of Light show.  \\n\\nOur dinner reservation was at 5:40 since we were trying to catch the 8:45 show. Unfortunately we arrived about 20 minutes late due to the bus running late.  Fortunately they were able to accommodate us.  The inside of the restaurant is really nice, each room is a different art gallery dedicated to conservation.\\n\\nI figured that still arriving at 6 would be plenty of time for the show but for some reason the hostess had us wait.  This was strange since it was very empty.  15 minutes later we were seated.  \\n\\nHaving been on safari in Africa I was excited by the menu as it had a lot of exotic meats.  We started with the charcuterie platter as a starter. I went with the duo of venison which had a venison filet and boerewors (South African sausage).  My wife went with the SA lobster enhancement and the Gobi cauliflower.\\n\\nI would say i was a little disappointed by the platter and my entree.  The starter was very small and the vension and sausage were not bad but served cold.  I will say that the lobster was amazing and so was the Gobi.\\n\\nI think the worst part of the restaurant has to be the service.  From the lackadasical hostess to the waiter which took FOREVER for dinner service unbelievably we did not make the 8:45 show.  On top of that it was one of our pricier meals that weekend.  \\n\\nOverall this place is definitely nice and the food isn't bad.  I think the exorbitantly long service and price make it just Ok for me.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"So have an hankering for Hainanese chicken but none can be found in Austin so I figured I would try the Thai version as the Thai Kun version was pretty good. Friends recommended the Thai Cuisine version so off we went.\\n\\nFirst of all the entranceway where you had to wait to be seated was a mess. People stacked up and the host came but he was so involved with a lady with a missing online order that he ignored all the people stacking up. After about 5 plus minutes of waiting another gentleman came out from the back apologized and immediately took charge and seated everyone.\\xa0\\n\\nFood that was ordered Pad Thai,\\xa0Kao Man Kai (steamed\\xa0chicken version not the fried), a Thai Tea and water. The Thai tea that came was awesome. It was a very tall glass, very surprised and impressed. The Pad Thai that came was tasty but the noodles were a bit over cooked but not too badly done. I do recommend this dish if you come looking for it.\\xa0\\n\\nThe\\xa0Kao Man Kai is a whole other story, so much I had to devote nearly my whole review on it. It came and it looked dry, like drink my whole huge Thai Tea and another glass of water dry. It's supposed to be the Thai version of\\xa0Hainanese chicken. It's supposed to be tender and juicy with nicely steamed rice made with the chicken broth/fat. It's was the complete opposite. First of all it was all white meat, dry skinless breast meat overcooked. Second tasteless, sigh. \\xa0Did I mention skinless? You are supposed to leave the skin on, not necessarily to eat, it's so when you cook/steam it that it does not dry up so horribly. The rice I was hoping had redeeming features, it didn't. It was steamed then looked like tossed with what looked like little fried onion bits. What it ended up being like was steamed soft rice with bits of what felt like uncooked rice (the fried onions that softened a bit in the steamed rice). Highly do not recommend.\\xa0\\n\\nOverall not too bad if you didn't want the chicken. \\xa0I wanted to try the purple rice dessert as that is my favorite Thai dessert but after eating the mess of the chicken we wanted our bill and to get out of there. The bill all total was under\\xa0$30\\xa0so not too expensive but next time stick with the noodles dishes.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This place is truly exceptional! \\n\\nMy big goofy pit bull managed to tear up her paws while out for a run and needed all four of them bandaged, and the staff here was just great with her. I imagine it must be pretty easy to find a good vet if you have an easy dog, but for owners like me with very particular pets, the demeanor and attitude of the staff is almost as important as their medical expertise, and the staff at Alpine is amazing. \\n\\nMy girl was rescued from dog fighting so she, understandably, has some quirks--she is extremely dog aggressive, is very uncomfortably with men, and is a mix of very strong and very tender. I was SO IMPRESSED with how the staff here treated us--I told the receptionist before we came in about her somewhat peculiar needs and they were more than accommodating. They made sure that only female members of the staff handled her and they made sure that she didn't interact with other animals, allowing us to wait in a separate room rather than the waiting room and shifting some things around in their treatment area so that she wouldn't have to be bandaged up near other pups. \\n\\nEveryone we interacted with was totally comfortable with her breed and her demeanor (they were incredibly understanding of her dog-aggression and there was absolutely no judgement of her as a bad dog or of me as a bad owner, which we've experienced with other places) and I would strongly recommend this place to other pit bull parents. \\n\\nI was really impressed with Dr. scwartzman--she was very gentle with my girl and did a wonderful job building a little bit of a relationship with her in the short time of our appointment, and she also took the time to explain the injury and treatment thoroughly to me and made sure to answer all of my questions.  \\n\\nThe vet techs were awesome as well--they gave my pup plenty of treats to help her feel more comfortable (they even used a frozen container of baby food to distract her, which I think is brilliant) and they did an excellent job with the bandages themselves. \\n\\nFinally, the front desk staff was spectacular--they were super nice and super helpful and they obviously care about the people and pets they get to interact with. \\n\\nI felt that the pricing here was very fair--I'm surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about the cost. Also, for me, the fact that they required an exam before treating her injuries was a huge plus--I wouldn't feel comfortable having a vet prescribe treatment or medication without first examining my dog, and at least to me, it seems far less a scam to get money out of unsuspecting owners and far more a hallmark of a responsible and well run medical practice.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Maybe my expectations were too high because of so many good reviews. Dunno, really. But my first Hopdoddy experience wasn't the greatest. Had a couple of out of town visitors for the day and we all decided to try Hopdoddy for lunch. The line to get in, which is normally down the block, was fairly short and manageable. My high hopes were lifted even more because of that. The line inside forms right down the middle of the restaurant. Which meant that my guests and I were asked to move out of a servers way many more times than once. Most were nice about it; you can't help being in the way because of how the line is set up. One server, who was apparently having a very bad day, was not so nice about it. He was downright rude, actually. And, no. We were not standing in the areas where signs directed us not to stand. We were merely standing in line waiting to order our food. We finally get to the counter to order. 2 burgers. 1 salad. Order of truffle fries. 2 milkshakes. 1 beer. Over $70 with tax and tip. That's a lot of money for a burger joint. I was also a little taken aback at being asked to tip before any service was given. But I did tip, because I appreciate and respect the work of food service workers. Got our table. Nice young woman brings our order. The truffle fries were amazing. Best part of the whole meal. Milkshakes were good, but not $6 each good. The burgers were the biggest disappointment. The other burger orderer at my table said his was ok, but not nearly as good as he had thought it might be. I took a bite of his. His assessment was correct. It was just a decent burger, nothing special. Mine was grossly undercooked in the middle. Our server never came back to the table to check on us and a very kind young man offered to go find her. She finally showed up after I had eaten the cooked edges of the burger and was no longer in the mood for the rest of it, cooked or not. I didn't really want another burger at that point. I didn't want what was left of the one I had to be cooked some more. Maybe I would have wanted those things 30-40 minutes earlier if she had ever come back to the table. She didn't offer any of those things, anyway, so it was a good thing I didn't want them, I suppose. She apologized that my burger was so undercooked. And left. I was appreciative that I at least got that. Maybe I went to Hopdoddy on a bad day. Maybe another visit would prove more satisfying. Not sure yet, whether I'm willing to give it another try or not. Those truffle fries sure were good, though. But, still.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"We are regulars at Marinepolis--one of the places that every member of the family enjoys, so it wins whenever it comes to a vote.  However, our last several visits have shown a sharp falling off of quality in ways that even my youngest child notices, and we're at the point of looking for another sushi restaurant.  This has caused a great disturbance in the force!  Hard to imagine we'll find another place as reasonably priced and high quality as this one used to be.\\n\\nOur visit last night is a good illustration of how things have gone very badly wrong with the restaurant in general:  We arrived at a time when a dozen seats at the sushi bar were open, and one table was also vacant.  However, dirty dishes and food littered all the spaces, so no seating was available.  We sat on the waiting bench for 15 minutes (!) watching the help talk to each other and move around the restaurant without attending to the customers who tried to get their attention.  Finally, one of the waitresses brought a tub and cleaned off the dishes, and another dragged a grey and filthy looking rag across the counter.  \\n\\nWhen we sat down, my kids noticed that our shoes were on food that other guests had dropped, and a lot of it.  The bits of rice were especially sticky, so it was hard to overlook, and once we glanced down, our appetites diminished.  It appeared that food had been accumulating all day, as it was a dirty mess underneath the table.  The supplies at the table itself were all out, aside from ginger and wasabi. The soy sauce was empty, no sauce dishes, and none at any adjacent places, either.  To her credit, one waitress responded quickly to our request and brought the needed implements.  \\n\\nThat was the one bright spot, though:  Our orders to the sushi chefs came very slowly, and we had to ask where they were before they showed up.  The waitresses seemed to feel we were intruding on their day, at least judging by their manner, and the whole place appeared dirty and shabby--not what you want in a restaurant that serves raw fish!  When we paid, the waitress at the register didn't say a word, no smile or thank you, no word at all, and I felt bad about having left a tip.  We feel that servers should be treated generously, but our experience last night made me think these young staff members should be fired!\\n\\nOn the whole, this was really not a good experience, and in keeping with each of our recent visits.  I don't know if ownership has changed, or someone just stopped caring, but the place seems run by kids who don't know or care about cleanliness and customer service.  So sad to see our favorite restaurant come to this end.\",\n",

The crowd is young and professional. The restrooms are usually SUPER clean too.  Prices are okay and for the area not bad at all.  Some desserts are overpriced though.  Other than that, great place to chill. \\n\\nKudos to Jaho!\",\n",

I give it three stars because the location is great, the setting, the mood, the lighting, very romantic.  And my date enjoyed his meal.  But I did not enjoy mine at all.  I got the gnocchi.  And it was just too mushy for me.  I felt like I was eating baby food.  They had it in three flavors, and the sweet potato flavor was just too sweet.  The green gnocchi was not bad, and the yellow one was too plain.  I ate only a few bites.  I would go back to try something different.\",\n",

I received a free foot salt scrub due to a scheduling issue, not bad! When a company offers you something in addition due to a mistake on their part, take it!

Mine was missing some toppings, and my husband's hoagie had only one piece of turkey.  The one thing that seems to be consistent is the ridiculously long wait. Tonight our hoagies took 25 minutes after we paid. Other customers were being asked to change their drink orders because the location had no dairy products in stock.

As far as I know, this might be the only place serving food in Davis past 2am on the weekend. Golden Light gets a large portion of its patronage from inebriated locals heading home from bars and looking for late night eats. \\n\\nThere isn't much I can describe that you guys haven't experienced before - you know what bad Chinese food is like. But after a night out, I will wait in line at this dingy place, and eat their crispy crab rangoons with a big fat smile on my face. \\n\\nHopefully Davis will have a couple of more late night options in the near future.\",\n",

Then started charging my card before asking for non-profit evidence and making it hard to get refunded. They just became a big PITA. I cancelled three weeks before renewal, but they charged my credit card anyway and did not resolve it with email or chat. There is no phone number to call.

He was provided a lot of entertainment jumping off of the truck to catch a banana spider and offering to catch any other wild life that we might come across. We fed cows along the trip and saw horses and a zebra and water buffalo along the tour.

Not that hard. \\n\\nThis is not the first time that I have encountered horrible service here. The first time I went to this restaurant we had to leave because we waited a half hour with no waiter or waitress even coming over to get a drink order. Not to mention that it was an odd time during the day when there was no more than 20 people there. \\n\\nI don't know who manages they need to hire more attentive wait staff that isn't just standing around diddling their thumbs.

Until here. 2 pages of boozy drinks but not even the hint of what their non-booze offerings were. Maybe if we'd shown up with a kid or stroller, we'd have gotten the non-alcoholic offerings. I probably wouldn't have gotten so bent out of shape about it if the waiter hadn't been a little taken aback that we asked about them. \\n\\nNow, onto the food. We all ordered burgers. And, for the most part, were happy with our choices. I had the Aunt Patty which was very tasty. The boyfriend had a bodacious bacon burger. Dad got the Texas ranger (which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done. We had 3 mediums and a medium-well in our group. I'd have kicked the review up to a 3 if they had cooked our stuff to order. There are plenty of M&E's in town who do things more consistently.\",\n",

For my main dish I ordered  pan seared scallops served with pea greens and grapefruit butter, which was deliciously flavorful but not too rich. The scallops were cooked perfectly - not too rubbery.

Good selection of sandwiches however, the bread used to make them leaves a lot to be desired.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, North Carolina style, topped with homemade cole slaw which was supposed to come on a sour dough roll??  The pulled pork was great but the bread could not support nor compliment the sandwich.  It literally turned to mush on the bottom and was inedible.  I did however wolf down the pulled pork which was delicious.  The bread ruined the sandwich.  The same was true for my wife's sandwich which was chicken tips.  Part of the problem could be that the sandwiches are served in a plastic basket lined with a piece of paper that also turns soggy along with the bread.  Too bad.  The menu looked interesting and I would have liked to return and tried more but, as a result, I won't be returning.  A $9.50 sandwich should be made with better bread.\",\n",

Two of the four people were given the wrong entree.  There were a series of mix ups where the replacement entrees were wrong.  The two who received the correct entrees found them bad.  One ribeye steak ($32.00) ordered medium rare was almost raw.  The other order of chicken and tri-tip (ordered medium) was very rare and so tough the person could not eat two of the tri-tip slices.

I watched one bartender walk by 5 times and look at our empty drinks, but never once did he ask if we wanted anything else.  My boyfriend had to ask for our check instead of it being offered to us. Honestly we would have had a second drink, but were never offered one and should not have to ask especially when the bar was not crowded at all. The food was actually really good. I had the classic macaroni & cheese, and my boyfriend had the candied bacon and bleu cheese burger.  This is the only reason I gave two stars.

Being that I usually spend around $75 or so on a haircut, I figured this was an area where I can try to cut costs.\\n\\nI contemplated going to a SuperCuts or HairCuttery, but thanks to fellow Yelpers' horrid reviews, I opted against it. I eventually stumbled upon the glowing reviews for Coco Head Hair Studio in Chinatown. Being that I work a mere few minutes walk away from Chinatown, it was worth a try.\\n\\nErnie was my stylist. He took a look at my hair (which I hadn't cut in about 5 months--I have a bad habit of doing that), asked questions, communicated his thoughts and vision for what to do and why, and always checked with me first before proceeding with anything. He was very meticulous with his work, and my haircut turned out great!  My hair somehow even looks healthier because of it. I can already tell that it's one of those haircuts that will continue to look great even as it grows out. Definitely worth the $38!\",\n",

We ordered lots of appies and dinner to follow. Dinner was very bland, no taste to the food and there was a lack of quality in the meat. After dinner we ordered desert and tea, while waiting for the desert a waitress told us to leave if we weren't ordering anything else (not knowing we had actually ordered desert). Completely rude and uncalled for specially because we had made reservations a week prior. They lack the skills to run a restaurant and were not prepared for more customers. Very disappointing, will most likely not return. At the end, we went to pay the bill, they had already added 15percent tip to the bill even though the service was extremely bad and they were trying to make us leave quickly so they can give the table to someone else. Be smart and read the reviews, this place is just not worth your time or money.\",\n",

Spinach tasted like spinach but nothing special. The bacon, which is nearly impossible to make taste bad, sucked.

The real kicker for me was the fact that the manager never came by one time to check on our table after we had sent a steak back twice.  Instead, our waitress offered us a free dessert.

There are some cool signs and television footage from the campaign. You can even read the original text of his inauguration speech.

The assassination is glossed over with news footage announcing his death, and the remainder of the museum is dedicated to Kennedy's legacy.\\n\\nGiven the Kennedy legacy, I expected more stories and items. There was very little mentioning of JFK's childhood, his relationship with Jackie, his children, or his Congressional career. Nothing negative about Kennedy was on display, which is unusual for a presidential museum. At both the Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford museums, the good and the bad are addressed.

The sauce was good but the chicken itself was a bit bland. None of the flavour was in the chicken for some reason, just in the sauce. The 8 oz. serving was served in a cup. I feel like it was less than 8 oz. Anyway, you got very little butter chicken for $9. It came with rice or naan. The naan wasn't actually good. I'd prefer to stick to the places that actually cook their naan the traditional way (as opposed to rubbery microwaved pita bread). You know you're at a rip-off Indian takeout when you run out of curry before naan. I'm used to the opposite. Overall, small servings, bad naan, dried out and flavourless chicken. The only reason to eat here is if everything else around is closed and you don't like Chinese food (which is how I found myself here). I would avoid this place. You're better off at Pita Pit around the corner where you get more food for less money and it's pretty decent for fast food.\",\n",

Pine nuts on rice, steamed and fresh tomatoes side by side, and very tender lamb make for an excellent dish. \\n\\nI'm also a fan of their fresh squeezed juices. Just had the carrot juice today and it was very fresh. Don't recommend the mint smoothie -- it was largely pieces of mint leaf on ice. Another must-have is the rice pudding. It's covered in shaved coconut, coconut milk and spices that make it taste remarkably different from usual bland rice pudding.\\n\\nNot a fan of the service. The key is to go to the bar and chase down a server rather than wait for them to come to you. Today I saw the table next to me wait half an hour for the menu; trying to pay is nearly impossible if you wait for the service staff. Just go to the bar directly. It's a shame the service is so bad, because the food is so good.\",\n",

We got there around 8pm, I guess they were so popular that day that they had ran out of most of the main dishes.. so ok.. we accommodated and ordered from what they said was available. First, we ordered the potato balls filled with ground beef. We waited about 30mins to get them, so OK. No big deal... to our surprise the balls were frozen on the inside.. Ok..that is not acceptable.. bad start.. we also ordered chicken soup. It was all brought, had about 1 inch (literally) of chicken and nothing else. We also have a churrasco ( I think), it was just ok. The only thing I really liked were the red beans (well seasoned) with white rice, which was everything I ate. Not sure if I will be back.  I did complain to the manager and pointed out the problems and he kept asking me what do you want? For Pete's sakes, you manage this restaurant. Apologize for the problems and offer a solution. For example, discount, free drink, voucher to come back and try the potato balls.. something. The guy is not a manager, the servers had more management potential that him.\",\n",

We had 2 double beds, a refrigerator (held alot of our sodas and snacks), iron and ironing board, flat screen TV, blow dryer and free wi-fi!!!! The pool was always crowded (it was summer after all). \\n\\nThe only downside I can see was that it was rather close to the highway, but it shouldn't affect your sleep. Traffic around this area can get pretty bad. What may be a 20 minute drive from this motel to downtown can turn in to an hour drive. Also, the exterior of the building could be touched up a bit to look nicer. \\n\\nOther that, this place is a great place to stay if you're on a budget. Great amenities, close to most points of interest (mall, UT, shopping centers) and very affordable. I highly recommend.\",\n",

When you first walk in you'll notice that not much has changed. However, I miss the reindeer coffee company. I'm not saying that Peet's is bad, in fact, it's great.\\n\\nThis may be surprising, but it was Peet's Coffee that inspired the modern coffee giant, Starbucks. Needless to say, the quality of coffee lives up to it's history. It's solid. On my first visit, I had a regular light-roast and sampled the latte and can testify that their coffee tastes like Starbucks... but with a bit of history. If you like and appreciate Starbucks, you'll like Peet's.\\n\\nYou won't find hipsters or frappachino sucking middle-schoolers at this here. Peet's Coffee appeals to a different crowd. Located on the corner of Upper Arlington, Peet's is a family-friendly coffee shop. It's well lit and has plenty of seats and tables, making it a great place to study and read.\\n\\nIf Starbucks is Luke Skywalker and Caribou Coffee is Darth Vader, then I give Peet's Coffee a rating of: Yoda\\n\\nCheck out more cafe reviews at roaringbean.com\",\n",

It currently occupies the #1 spot.\\n\\nI'll start with the bad: Delivery takes a long time, and these pies are fairly expensive. Delivery (which I request through Foodler) takes about an hour, which is longer than my hungry stomach would like but pretty typical for delivery pizza around here. At about $22 for a large, Il Mondo is not a bargain. That said, it's less expensive than Crazy Dough, which is its main rival for the Amy B. Pizza Crown.\\n\\nNow on to the good--the very, very good. The buffalo chicken pizza is out of this world. It's generously topped with chunks of buffalo-marinated chicken and drizzled with ranch (my favorite). I'm into chicken on pizzas and so have also enjoyed the chicken with roasted red peppers and spinach, but I keep coming back to the buffalo chicken. The crust on these pies is on the thin side, so be forewarned if you're a thick crust junkie.\\n\\nThe pizza, in fact, is so to my liking that it pains me not to give Il Mondo five stars. But the price and delivery time are both just high enough that I can't. In any case, this is pizza I will keep on my speed dial (metaphorically speaking--what is this, the 90s?).\",\n",

I am not a fan of orange beef so when someone from my table wanted it, I hesitantly agreed. Since I was biased before we ordered it, I will not say it was good or bad. The salty fish fried rice was just the right amount of salty on the fish. The inconsistent things which disappoint me are the salt and pepper squid and the shrimp in tofu.

We got there around 8 and there was a nice, pleasant crowd. The music often surprised me with a throw back from my childhood (hats off to the dj). All of the games are free to play and there wasn't a cover. The beers were reasonably priced and I didn't mind paying a little more since we were playing free games. The decor was impressive. A very interesting cocktail menu...we ordered 'Weird Science' and it was entertaining AND not bad tasting! 15$ well spent since it was a beverage that was fun and delightful. \\nThe place started getting packed around 1030, 11 on a Thursday night. That's when you find yourself waiting for a turn on the games and so we called it a night at about 1130. Had a blast and couldn't stop ranting about it. \\nThe only qualm I Had (which also reminded me of my youth) was the temperment of the Atari and ninetendo, having to fiddle with the games to get them to work...which wouldn't discourage me to return! It's the nature of these vintage machines. Thank you Joysticks for allowing me to relive my youth vicariously through your memorabilia, music, and all your retro touches.

Why were we treated like this?

       "  'text': 'We love McMenamins and rarely venture out elsewhere when we choose to go out to eat.  A couple of weeks ago we brought family members to Kennedy School, after telling them all about how wonderful McMenamins was and that they had to experience it for themselves.  One of the things I highlighted is that the service, drink, and food is consistently great.\\n\\nA week or so later, my boyfriend and I came to this location as a celebration for completing our move that day from Beaverton, OR to Vancouver, WA.  The restaurant was fairly busy but service was fine and the beer was great.  The food however took a very long time and when it came out was not good at all.  My boyfriend and I ordered what we order about 90% of the time (burgers) and were both very disappointed.  I immediately remarked that my burger tasted like a burger from elementary school BBQ day - dry and charcoal-tasting.  My boyfriend showed me that his burger bun was dry and crumbling away, and by the middle of his burger there was hardly any bun left in his hands.  He also commented that his fries were cold, which made me think that our burgers may have been fine initially but left under the food warmer for too long before being brought out.\\n\\nI am sure we will venture here again as we live so close, but we definitely left this last visit with a bad taste in our mouth about the Vancouver location.  Hopefully what we experienced was a rare occurrence for this location and not the norm.',\n",

One thing that I needed was a new set of tires and I noticed they had a sale on tires. The tires on my bike weren't a standard size and were not on sale. Regardless, Motocorsa special ordered me the tires and gave me the sale price anyway without having to ask. I was very thankful since I was already dumping a lot of money into the bike.\\n\\nFast forward to two weekends ago, my bike was unfortunately backed into while it was parked and the insurance company totaled it. I went into Motocrosa and Christian helped me look for a bike that fit my budget. He did an amazing job at helping me figure out what I wanted, since the old bike I had isn't made anymore. Christian really did a lot to look for a bike for me even though it is an incredibly busy time of year for the dealership and my budget was low. I didn't expect such great service since there wasn't a ton of money to be made from me but he did a great job! I ended up finding a bike from a private party. Christian was excited for me and didn't make me feel like I made a bad decision by not buying something from him. \\n\\nI had a great experience at Motocorsa and they definitely have my business in the future.

It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston/Allston area.\\nFor about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. \\n\\nSo I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.\\n\\nAND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place.\",\n",

Tilapia and avocado, an excellent taco even with with Quality Seafood's offerings looming just down the street.\\n- The Pineapple Pork. Pork carnitas and pineapple with scallions, also pretty good.\\n- The Kim Lee BBQ. Korean BBQ pork with kimchi and scallions, on 2 toasted Hawaiian sweet rolls. This was amazing, a perfect blend of sweetness from the rolls and savory from everything else. It was like the ultimate stoner food (not a bad consideration keeping in mind the neighborhood around it, especially considering that they apparently deliver nearby until 10pm most nights. Hmm....).\\n\\nMost tacos are $3.75, with the exception of the larger items like the Kim Lee, which is $5.75 and deserves every penny of its price tag. This trailer seems to prefer corn tortillas for the tacos, which is fine with me. Next time I'll probably check out the Mexican Bun Dog, which puts sausage and bacon on the Hawaiian sweet rolls, and sounds too good to pass up.\",\n",

The place wasn't to busy, and our service was wonderful. I ordered a cup of clam chowder for my appetizer. It was exactly the way I like it, typical with perfect combination of cream, potato, spice and clams.  I ordered fish and chips and my husband ordered scrod. My fish was made up of small fried bites, I prefer a larger filet, they seemed like it was more breading then fish, it was served English style. I ordered potato wedges as my chips, they were soaking in oil. I couldn't even try them. It seems that people don't let the oil settle before placing on fries lately. But I love fish and chips and keep trying. My husbands scrod was good he said, but just average because of all the stuff he had to scrape off the top of it (he calls it filler to make the dish look bigger) so we gave 3 stars. I will go back for chowder and try the lobster roll if we are down this way again...we keep looking for great fish and chips and grilled, no frills, fish...and our quest continues, I want to mention that there are a lot of regulars we met there that day so I think our luck was just bad, we didn't try desert.\",\n",

It was a church from the early 1900's and then turned into a house of blues.  It's definitely an Atlanta landmark.  I've seen some of my favorite shows here- Prince, Justin Timberlake, Matisyahu, Pharrell, etc.  Also came last night to watch Ali Wong's comedy show.  There isn't a bad seat in the house at the Tabernacle.  It's an intimate venue with 3 viewing levels.  The acoustic is great too inside.  They also have several drink stations throughout the venue.  Note- they have to take off the caps on the water bottles here so drink up. \\n\\nThe only downfall I could think of us is that there are no elevators and tons of stairs so plan accordingly.  If you don't want to climb a lot of stairs I would suggest getting seats on the main floor or second floor.  The seats on the second balcony (3rd level) I feel has very good view of the stage but the seats are pretty close from row to row.   There isn't a lot of legroom but I think that's probably one of the best views in the venue if you're sitting in the middle.  If you sit on the main floor your neck would definitely hurt because you would have to look up.\\n\\nIf you haven't seen a show here, I highly recommend it!  I hope they never go away.  I hope they will alway maintain the history of the interior.\",\n",

If I'm Downtown during dinnertime or lunchtime, you'll most likely find me at Samurai.\\n\\nThe food is excellent. They offer a whole variety of authentic Japanese cuisine, some of which I rarely find at any other Japanese restaurant. For sashimi fans, they have a variety of sashimi for you to choose from. I've never had a bad experience with the sashimi I've ordered here. The meat is sliced very cleanly and prepared well. For makizushi and nigirizushi lovers, they have a wide assortment of rolls to pick from. I particularly liked their spicy salmon rolls, which definitely lived up to their namesake! As for other entrees, they offer some really great dishes. The teriyaki options are awesome. Their ramen, yakiudon and yakisoba are very delicious. My new favourite is the tonkatsu, which is sublime!\\n\\nThe service is very good. They are quick to take your order, deliver your food, and refresh your tea. Payment is a bit of a hassle since you must line up by the cramped register area which is near the kitchen and bathrooms, but other than that I've had no problems with the service here. They can also answer any questions you have about the food which is useful when ordering things you've never tried before.\\n\\nI would most definitely recommend Samurai. The only thing to keep in mind is that this place is in the heart of Davie St., so during peak hours there will be quite a wait to get a seat.\",\n",

It came out faster than I was able to find my debit card! Which isn't a bad thing but umm okay. So after I saw the lamb I went back on my yelp app and said showed the lady taking orders that I wanted the lamb with the red sauce or what not. She told me I should have asked for that and normally they charge but she wouldn't this time! How about instead of treating this order like an in-and-out burger you take the time to ask more questions, especially being a first timer (yes she knew because I told her)!! She took it back to the kitchen and In 2 minutes I was out the door. Got home and the aroma already had me leery of eating! It was strong and pungent! Almost to the point of overwhelming (perhaps spoiled even) As for the rice and cabbage that's where the 2 stars stop! The lamb was underwhelming and a bit over cooked. I'm a medium to medium-well type chick and I get they don't accommodate to that extent,  but well done is a no-no!!! Also the red oil was seeping through my bag and got everywhere! Yea I won't be back but for a cheap dinner, I guess it was worth the try...Oh and I placed it in my fridge aiming to give it another shot the next day, I gagged trying to eat the leftovers!!!\",\n",

It was all of our first time. The restaurant was a huge vast empty room at 7 o clock on a Sunday. There were 2 tables sitting outside on this beautiful Sunday evening. We were tempted to sit outside or just in the bar area but since we made reservations, decided to sit at a table. Every step of the way was extremely and painfully awkward and full of missteps. The server was extremely uninformed of the house wine types. We asked if we could get items off the 'cafe' menu and he didn't know and then informed us the kitchen said no. He didn't write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks, forgot an appetizer (and when we asked about it, was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it????) and got one of the main courses wrong. And that was after he blamed the computer for malfunctioning and so he had to ask again to confirm our dinner orders. Twice I had to get up to ask for more water. And this is an empty restaurant! I personally have been a server for the last 15 years and can not believe the service and lack of care from the guy. For the kind of money you're charging, the food better be damn good and even better service. The food was alright but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. No wonder the place was empty.\",\n",

Food came out fast, I tasted the biscuit and the steak and shook my head. Biscuit was chewy (good biscuit suppose to melt in your mouth!), fried steak was not very flavorful (I had very good fried steak before). The shrimps were actually not bad but hey, we came here for breakfast not diner.\\n\\nHowever, I enjoyed the atmosphere very much. It has this vintage diner look but clean and cozy. Someone in a bear costume greeted us in the parking lot and we took a pic with him, I thought that was kind of fun and unique, my kids would have loved it. 70s music in the background, I loved it! Everyone was nice, waiting was not long although it was packed!\\n\\nMaybe we didnt order the right entre but biscuit and gravy is what I love and they didnt do it right. I wont be back, but that doesnt mean you and your family shouldnt give it a try.',\n",

       "  'text': \"First of all I'd say they are more of a 3.5 star place for me.  We started with an amuse of a lightly smoked salmon crudo and a small butternut squash soup.  I then had foie gras 2 ways (seared and a torchon).  The torchon I think was the better of the 2 preparations although there was a string of connective tissue in it which I found a little unappetizing.  Also I felt that it could have benefited from a couple of crystals of sea salt on the top to give it a little more flavor.  My wife had the organic lettuce salad with fruits and olive oil.  It was well.... a salad nothing bad about it but I would not call it outstanding either.  I had the rack of lamb and my wife had a piece of soy glazed sable fish.  The sable fish had a nice texture.  It was kind of like a cross between cod and sea bass and it had some firmness but not as firm as cod and a slight buttery flavor to it but not as buttery as sea bass either.  I ordered my lamb chops medium rare but they came out a little closer to medium.  For dessert we both had a Grand Marnier souffle.  It's been a VERY long time since I have had a properly done souffle.  They certainly have a good example of the breed here.  Also try the Canadian ice wine here.  It is addictive.  If the torchon and the lamb had been properly executed I'd have given them 4 stars.  At this price point, you have to execute flawlessly with every dish.\",\n",

Wasn't friendly when approaching us, didn't check back in after we got  our food, and took so long bringing us a check even after we had empty plates and cash ready that we finally just left what we owed and got out of there.  It wasn't even busy.  \\n\\n2. The food all seemed good on the menu.  All pretty basic stuff.  They had scambles, pancakes, etc.  I got a breakfast sandwich and it was just...meh.....All the right ingredients but it just felt...unspecial.  My breakfast date said in theory everything should be good, but also described her food as lackluster.  Too bad. \\n\\n3. There were not one, but two small hairs on my plate.  I understand things happen, but two kinda icked me out.  \\n\\n4. THERE WERE FLIES EVERYWHERE.  I don't understand if this was just our table or the whole restaurant, but there were largish fruit flies crawling all over the wall by our table and all around us.  Super SUPER gross.  Maybe one, but I couldn't believe I counted over 15 flies, just above us on the wall.  It was disgusting, unsanitary, and distracting trying to keep the flies from landing on our food.  I wold have said something or asked to move if ANYONE had come to our table to check on us.  \\n\\nGross.  I hope I never have to go back.\",\n",

I decided to go with one of the sandwiches Guy Fieri had on the show, the modern version of a sloppy joe and my husband got the lemongrass chicken sate. We then split both so we could each try.

I enjoyed the fries with the few different sauces we got so much more. \\n\\nThe different sauces they have to dip your fries into (and whatever else you want to dip into it) are what set this place apart. If you order a regular size or larger fries you get one free sauce, otherwise each one costs $0.75. \\n\\nI will say that this place is not cheap at all! We got two sandwiches, fries, a couple sauces, a beer and a cider and it was like $50-55. I know the beer and cider made it more expensive, but I felt it was still a bit much for what we had. I guess they have to pay their employees and for that pretty central locale somehow huh? \\n\\nAnywho, I would still recommend this place, it wasn't bad, just pricey. Loved the fries and sauces.

From the outside, you can see that the facade doesn't look like a typical Chinese restaurant, mainly because this isn't a Chinese take out place... but a classy establishment looking to transport you on a short trip to China. My favorite part about this restaurant is the ambiance. The decor is very intricate and looks like you are sitting in a garden in China, complete with koi ponds around the perimeter. \\n\\nService here is quite friendly, as our waiter was very nice and attentive. There was also a good drink menu, with many choices and some special tropical/ Asian inspired cocktails thought up by the bartenders. However, despite the great drinks, and beautiful decor, the food was mediocre. We had crispy tofu which was good, as was the mooshoo pork wraps, however the General T's Chicken wasn't crispy at all. In Ming Court's defense, we strolled up around 9pm and they were tidying up some areas for the night. I think we were one of the last patrons to come in. There is a stage set up, so it looks like there is live music and performances during earlier hours of operation... too bad we missed out on that because we came later in the night. Overall, our experience was okay. I would come more for the service, ambiance, and experience over food. Don't forget to have a few drinks here too- very tasty and at good prices!\",\n",

It was my first time there and it was a cool looking venue with a lot of activities, large parking lot, well lit, and we planned to make a night of it but the dinner went so badly we didn't bother. After ordering at 6:30, the food came out in very separate waves starting at 7:30 so no one ate at the same time. My pizza never came out despite following up with the waitress each time we saw her (which was only about 4 times in the 3 hours). We finally chased down a manager to find our checks and she said she would do me a favor and remove the pizza. I pointed out I had never received a pizza and she told me I had. The entire interaction was baffling. It took about another half an hour to get a check for the one drink I had, which the manager then decided to comp. They did also offer a free play card, which I declined as I needed to leave and eat, and didn't care to ever return. I really wanted my 3 hours back more than the free drink or arcade time. I was utterly starving at that point so I left and went to the Chipotle up the street, 3 hours after I had sat down to eat at Main Event. The people who did receive their food enjoyed it despite the wait, and I do appreciate that they comped my drink (and, I guess, my pizza I forgot to remember eating).\",\n",

Apparently even during a crazy event such as the Final Four.  Pricing will vary.  Convenient to MARTA.  However, lines can be quite long after an event.  Plenty of bathrooms.  Plenty of concession stands. Efficient entry process. Loved that they could do indoor fireworks! Fun. Even the view from the very top isn't that bad.\\n\\nCons: Why do the concession people have to take your bottle lids?  Really?  At first, I thought it was cause they wanted the Coke points.  But they do it even for water.  The whole point of me getting a bottle is so that I can reseal it and not have to worry about it spilling.  When I am buying alot of food, it also helps if I can slip the drink in my purse to carry other things.  I do appreciate the one guy that gave me some aluminum foil to put on top.  Super nice gesture.  \\nAlso, some of the concession people could use some training on their items and on being personable.  Ran into a few grumpy ones (but maybe they had a good reason to be grumpy). In the nuts line, I asked for some candied pecans. Got almonds instead.

The baked chicken is perfectly done, juicy, and covered with coarsely ground spices.  The pot roast is tender, flavorful and rich.  Delicious. \\n\\nSurprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. \\n\\nAnother surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.

Normally I don't write a bad review the first time I go somewhere new but this place bugged me.\\n\\nI ordered two things a bacon poutine and a chicken club sandwich both were underwhelming and the service was poor.\\n\\nWhere to start..\\n\\nFalse advertising, it is personal now!\\n\\nWhen I order something that clearly states what it is like a BLT, I don't expect to get a roast beef on rye.\\n\\nSo when I order a BACON poutine, don't give me diced ham, bacon is a cured meat, ham is roasted, both can be smoked but they have very different flavours.\\n\\nGravy should not be thinner then water..\\n\\nFries should not be undercooked.\\n\\nSad that such a simple thing can go so wrong.\\n\\nOn to the chicken club sandwich, to make this sandwich look bigger they use a dinner role as a bun. The chicken nice and crispy but there was more breaking then chicken. Oh and did I mention the liberal sweet sweet mustard sauce that was all over this thing!\\n\\nI picked up the sandwich and the bun was soaking in it, inside and out, I could not taste anything else but the sauce.\\n\\nNo where on the menu did it say anything about that sauce, and the server never asked me what I wanted or did not want on my sandwich.\\n\\nAnd the final slap on the face, the two guys running the kitchen never even bothered to come out of the kitchen, it was too much for one of them to take my order at the front counter.\\n\\nThe same guy who made my food also passed my the debit terminal without cleaning his hands or wearing any gloves.\\n\\nSomeone needs to learn some food safe and customer service.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"An awesome little place, in a really nice part of Germantown, with awesome food.  My family and I went here for lunch, with tasty results.  Portions are large and hearty-- I had the buffet, which is a great value for the money if you love German Sausages.  When you get the buffet, you also get a discount when you purchase one of their delicious desserts.  \\n\\nMy family ordered the hot pretzel nuggets, which are fried, delicious, and tasty, especially with the honey mustard sauce they serve it with.  Generous portions, and not oily at all.  The original sausage sandwich was huge, more than enough for my sister and mom, and was served with a hearty portion of spatzle. \\n\\nThe buffet saw a number of side dishes, including green beans, cabbage, bean and ham soup, mac and cheese, red cabbage, German potato salad, sauerkraut, and several salad items, including applesauce, a green salad, and bread rolls.  While the sausage stew tasted a little strange, it wasn't too bad, and the buffet had 5 different types of sausage.  Everything was freshly stocked and tasted great.  Note that when you pick up a buffet, you can buy a dessert (normally $4-$5) for $2.50.  \\n\\nFor dessert, the four of us split two cream puffs-- one chocolate, one vanilla.  These were GREAT.  The cream was rich and soft, and there was definitely no cutting back on the good stuff!\\n\\nTo top off the whole affair, service was terrific.  Parking is easy, and it's definitely a memorable experience.\",\n",

We sat at the bar and ordered the polla con camarones ajillo (chicken with garlic shrimp) and she had the fried pork.  The best thing about this meal was the Fried Yucca which we ordered a side of. The rest was MEH at best. \\nOne issue we had was actually getting our food. We were the first to sit at the bar top and order out of 7 people and the last to get our food. we were patient and we kept hearing (your food will be right out) but it took the longest out of the whole bar. We didnt complain nor brought any attention about it. When we got those dishes half was missing from each and took alittle additional time to get. \\nThe chicken with garlic shrimp lacked flavor. Not by alittle but by alot. I was hoping to taste garlic but we couldnt at all. The sauce was watery and lacked any consistency on what i would expect a sauce to be. We had 3 little ramekins of that garlic sauce and put it on everything. We both feel kinda queezie and now think those were bad. I didnt think of it at the time but the consistency of that garlic stuff was more on the thicker side (possible built up slimyness). thinking maybe it was in that bar fridge for too long. Her fried pork was okay but it too lacked seasoning. The rice and the Yucca are the reason why this place gets one star above the worst. Like i said i had eaten here before and it was great. I ordered the Bandeja and the blood sausage was my favorite. i think ill try this place again and chalk this one up as an anomaly.',\n",

Right off Congress in the shade, small picnic tables and a few chairs. It's right next to the Austin Juice trailer. (Which is also in my passbook, I plan to try that soon!)\\n\\nWe ordered the Croque-Madame. And then ordered a custom sandwich with a Hawaiian bun, cheddar, ham, an egg, spinach, and jalapeño cream cilantro sauce. \\n\\nIt was tough for me to decide which one I liked better but I think I settled on the Croque-Madame. It was a little sweet but the flavors combines were amazing. \\n\\nOur custom sandwich wound up being really good too, mostly thanks to the sauce. I highly recommend the jalapeño cream cilantro sauce.  It wasn't spicy to me at all but it had an amazing flavor. I'm a sucker for anything cilantro. \\n\\n*The sourdough bread did get a little soggy, but it didn't bother me (might bother others). The Hawaiian bun stayed pretty toasted and crispy.*\\n\\nOur sides were a fruit cup and tomato soup (cute!). The fruit cup was green apples and oranges, refreshing and the fruit tasted fresh. The tomato soup was good. Had some chunks in it, probably tomatoes. So that was a strange consistency, but the taste was really good. I think having tomato soup at a grilled cheese trailer is a great idea. \\n\\nI'd definitely go back to try a different combination or a different sandwich. The ones we got were really good, but I'm looking for that one to be blown away by. =]\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I love Forest Park. I live in St. Johns and go there at least 3 times a week with my dog to wear her out. I spend most of my time on the Newton Road trailhead and have a few loops around there that I love to watch change with the seasons. \\n\\nConfession: Forest Park has a strict leash requirement which I consistently break with my dog. I know this is bad and naughty. I do keep my dog under control and as a canine good citizen and wildlife conservation dog, she is very well trained. \\n\\nThat said, I have a big concern. The last time I was in the park, a park employee or volunteer was out spraying herbicides on the blackberries to get rid of them. They told me my dog should be on leash because, 1.) them's the rules and 2.) the herbicide can cause serious eye damage to animals that come in contact with it. As long as we stay on the trail, it should be fine, they told me. This concerned me greatly because, of course, I don't want my dog near any kind of herbicide that can make it go blind and more importantly, no one gave that memo to the wild birds, rodents and mammals that live in the park. Such a bummer! I'd happily thrown in extra time to help eradicate blackberries manually or contribute to a fund that would employ workers to tear out the blackberries in a way that doesn't involve dangerous poison. \\n\\nAnyway. Yelp always filters my reviews, so this will probably never see the light of day, but thought park fans should know that there are dangerous herbicides being sprayed throughout the park and to be careful not to let your dog come into contact with them.\",\n",

I went on a Tuesday around 3pm with my sister and we walked right on in without an appointment. The first thing I noticed was how pretty and clean this salon is. It is decorated very nicely form the color of the walls to the changing lights in the ceiling and heart shaped chandelier. I was shocked on how many chairs and tables they had in the salon and they had an enormous array of different colors and brands of polishes. \\n\\nI went in for a pedicure and was offered a free beverage, but not wine like many people on here state. After getting into the water I was handed a booklet of different pedicures which did mention free wine. I picked out the 2nd lowest pedicure which was $35. The basic pedicure is $25 and unless your feet are bad, I would stick to the basic. The extra $10 of care did nothing for me. The chairs were nice and the whole process itself went smoothly. A young boy did mine and he was very nice. In the chair I was sitting in, you didn't not have a good view of a TV if that's something that you enjoy doing while having a pedicure. I just looked at my phone the whole time. \\n\\nThe only reason I give this 4 stars and not 5 is because it was a nice experience, friendly staff, nice pedicure but nothing blew me out of the water. There was nothing that said to me, you have to come back here again next time. My sister did have her nails done and they looked beautiful. White with silver glitter tips, but she did say that compared to other places she goes to, they were quite pricey. I believe just a color change was $17.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Great Italian food!\\n\\nHad a reservation for dinner with the boyfriend.  When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  \\n\\nPros:\\nThe food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.  (I personally think it's partially because he can practice his Italian with Daniela.)  He and I don't always agree on food (among other things) but we both loved all our dishes.  Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).\\n\\nCons:\\nThe draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.  I understand that in a tasting, the portions are scaled back, but we both left the restaurant that night a bit unsatisfied.  \\n\\n\\nThe interior/ambiance of the restaurant leaves something to be desired but if you are looking for really good Italian food, visit Andiamo and you will not be disappointed!\",\n",

It's a very clean and simple mall.\\nA lot of the usual main stores you will find at any other malls. Food court is decent with the main mall foods. There are a few restaurants attached to the mall such as Outback Steakhouse and a newly opened Trago Mexican Restaurant. There's also a pet store in the mall where you can see or purchase puppies, kittens, bunnies, fish, etc. \\nA big kids play area right near the main entrance. There's a library on the second floor. The Cinetopia is also inside the mall which was just newly added a few years ago. A new Gold's Gym will be opening where the old Nordstrom use to be. Good seating area around especially by the Starbucks and Teavana is a big open area. Pretty much all the major phone services has a kiosk here.\\nDuring major holidays like Christmas, Santa Claus will be there to take pictures. \\nBad thing about the mall is that there is no wifi throughout the entire mall. When they renovated the mall few years ago they took out the escalators/elevator from the middle and now they are on both ends of the mall. I guess it's a good way to make people walk the entire mall to go up or down but sucks when you know where you want to go and have to walk farther than you have to. After school time you will see a lot of high schoolers who hang around here. \\nIt's a good place to walk and window shop but the small size of the mall and lack of stores can limit your exploration.\",\n",

If you can get a west facing, high story room then it's worth it.  \\n\\nThe only thing that could have improved that view is if they had had chairs out on the balcony.  It would have been nice to sit there and enjoy a drink.  However, now that I think about it, they probably want people to have to go to Cloud 9, their rotating restaurant and bar to do that.  \\n\\nThe hotel itself is outdated and we heard rumors that they are shutting it down, so maybe that's why they haven't updated it.  Our room was clean, appliances and bathroom fixtures were old and in need of some love.  The headboard of the bed banged annoyingly against the wall every time you even leaned on it. I feel bad for whoever our neighbors were.  \\n\\nThis hotel is also the only establishment we visited in Vancouver where I encountered irritated staff and sub par customer service.  Again, if the closing rumors are true then maybe they are just disgruntled. Both front desk employees that we spoke to seemed to be irritated by our presence.  We arrived very early and requested early check-in.  I understand that early check-in can not be guaranteed but we were told to come back at noon (an hour after check-out) and our room should be ready.  We walked around and had lunch and decided that at 1pm we had definitely given them enough time.  The next front desk employee, also annoyed by our presence, told us that check-in was at 3pm, no exceptions.  \\n\\nThe WiFi was slow but free.  \\n\\nDon't bother with Cloud 9.  The drinks are over priced and mediocre.  It takes a solid hour for the restaurant to make its turn, so unless you want to spend $50 on drinks or milk one for an hour, just go up there and walk around it and you'll get the gist.

We asked to sit at a bar top table to get a few drinks, we were told no, however another group was allowed.  I tried to ask the hostess who gave me some serious attitude why.  Not to mention the reason for the long wait was reduced staff, I guess because 20 open tables and 5 members of the wait staff having lude conversations at the hostess station was more important.

Then she the proceeded to sit everyone else but us, even people that had arrived only 5 mintues ago.\\n\\nWe didn't get a waitress for 10 minutes who brought us our drinks with no alcohol.

I had never been, but I had heard good things about the jazz brunch and bad things about the waiting times for said jazz brunch. I got there a little early, and was immediately confused about where the front desk was; no one asked if I needed help or directed me to the hostess's desk. After wandering around, I saw someone standing at another desk in a separate room around the corner. I asked how long was a wait for two, and she said maybe 20 minutes. Just then, some space opened up at the bar and we swooshed into the seats. SWOOSH! Win.\\n\\nThe bar is a bit of an awkward shape, narrow in design and cramped, so it's not clear who is standing around waiting for a table and who is actually being served. Our server/bartender was pretty attentive, though clearly busy. She got the point, took our drink orders, gave us the menus, took our food orders, brought our drinks, and then our food showed up. I liked that you could add grits or oatmeal; I love oatmeal with brown sugar, which they keep on the countertop. It was a bit thick and gloppy but tasty enough.\\n\\nI ordered one of the brunch specials, the eggs benedict, which came with tomato and asparagus and ham and some fruit on the side, and Erin got pancakes. The food was okay; my hollandaise sauce wasn't the best I'd had, and it kind of overwhelmed the dish. The poached eggs were a little overcooked, and I love 'em runny and gooey.\\n\\nWe could hear some jazz in the background, but it didn't contribute much to the ambiance. With the just-fine quality of the food, I would much rather wait 40 minutes for bluegrass brunch at Highland Kitchen.\",\n",

To start, we shared a California roll, which was made to order and very good. I chose the Thai cashew entree, which was sautéed with a choice of meat with mushroom, onion, bell pepper, celery, carrot, pineapple and cashew nuts. My fiancé chose the garlic black pepper entree, which was sautéed with a choice of meat with black pepper, garlic, onion, broccoli, bell pepper and topped with dried garlic. You can also choose to add some heat to any dish that they have. With this being our first time here, we played it safe with our choices (and level of spiciness) and just chose chicken, but I noticed a few other people's dishes looked very appetizing as well. Both entrees were so good, and had us wishing we had brought some home with us! The portion sizes were on the large size.  I noticed some other reviewers having not so great things to say, but overall, I couldn't really find anything bad to say. \\n\\nAnother thing to note is that the atmosphere of this place is really cool. When you step inside, you walk through this long corridor and then into the restaurant which is not at all what you'd expect it to look like, judging from the outside.  It is located in an area called Little 5 Points. I've been coming to L5P's since I was about 10-if you haven't checked it out, you should! It can be described as Atlanta's spot for alternative, hip, grungy, boho culture all mixed into one! You can find a few great record stores, coffee houses, vintage clothing stores, skate shops, tattoo shops, comics, an art gallery, furniture, and many other odd shops. There are great places to eat there too, Thai 5 being one of them!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I was surprised when I read the reviews of MM, but after using them for my initial CPAP experience and then follow on visits, I learned a lot. When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\\n\\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones. However, those that appear to have good ratings, may not take your insurance. The highest rated one took none of ours. That would mean everything out of pocket.\",\n",

The cheese as an appetizer was good but the remaining food we ordered was very bad ! \\nWe ordered our kids Mac and cheese and they only had one plate left . Really I have 3 children and 2 of them wanted the Mac . What restaurant in Orlando in the midst of tourist  has one meal of a kind left ? And it's Mac and cheese ??? So they taught . Our waiter was nice enough to split it as if it was 2 entrees so they wouldn't fight . I appreciated that but even after it was split the position was ridiculously small ! \\nBtw our waitress was nice !\\nThen we ordered the fried calamari , it wasn't the good quality type I can't explain it was so rubbery ! I just had calamari last night and got me wanting more ! \\nThe dip they had was made In house , ok I'll give them credit for being unique but unfortunately I did t like the sauce !! So that just went down hill !\\nWe also ordered the ground beef meat balls ... Ewe... So out of the can !!! Definitely not fresh! \\nWe also orders Falafel ,it was horrible . I can't explain anymore it hurts ! \\nAt the end our we were charged for the my son's drink a kiddie soda . But it's included in their meal so why was I being charged for the soda that just completely lean mean mean months, and the waitress explained since she entered in the order that my son ordered water that was considered his complementary drinks, are you serious?! Since when do we pay for tap water ! So I asked her to remove it and she said that's just the way the system works I told her please go talk to your manager or this is going to be a big issue then she finally went and removed it. That completely threw me off and pushed me to give her a 10% tip. I visit Orlando one see year and I always look forward visiting my favorite spots this is definitely one place I will never return to!\\nEw!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Tavern in the Square is the kind of place I would come back to for simple appetizers to get some food in my belly when I haven't had a chance to have dinner before having drinks. I ordered the electric lemonade it was delicious and kind of strong despite all the ice. I am glad I split the big dig fries with someone as it was huge portion, and really good. Although waffle fries smothered in cheese and sour cream,  you have to be  a real moron to mess that up.\\n\\nWhen I first arrived and was waiting for others to joined me, I sat at the bar next to some guy, who got meatloaf that didn't seem all that great, I caught some of his conversation with the bartender and he was asking her what kind of meat was in there, and said it was dry and tasteless and didn't taste like beef. She offered to call the manager.  We moved to a table after that so I don't know what happen with it.  I definitely  wouldn't come here for dinner. This seems more like the kind of place to grab a few simple dishes. The bar was a nice size but pretty crowded by eight, but it was Friday. \\n\\nOne last note the waitresses and some of the bartenders seem to be lacking in customer service skills. When I first arrived I saw them clustered at the end of the bar, I looked their way for a while, and eventually had to wave my hand.  There was a blonde facing me she looked over blankly several times and didn't tell the bartender who was in charge of my side that I need service so I ended up waiting a while before she came over. After we got a table the same blonde again,  asked us to move (without knowing we had permission from the hostess and waitress) on one hand I know she was just doing her job, but I felt like she should have asked her coworkers first, or even us before ordering us to move. It wasn't a big deal or anything, and after we told her she just said ok, so I know she wasn't trying to be rude. The red headed waitress who ended up serving me was great, although I  felt bad because I ordered from her then tipped at the table so I owe her one next time I go there.\",\n",

I love spicy food but this was spicy even for me. If you do not handle spice well, do NOT get it Laos style. I'm not sure if the regular style is as spicy. I LOVED this papaya sald. It was funky in all the right ways and left me tearing up but I love the burn.\\n\\n- Beef larb (ordered it regular and rare): TIP! You can order the beef larb rare, essentially making it like a tartare. It is so full of flavor! I will probably always order this when I go. It feels super fresh and healthy because of all the herbs\\n\\nLemongrass ribs: The ribs had great flavor and are pretty big. So $8 for 2 might seem like a lot, but the ribs are bigger than typical ribs\\n\\nNam Khao: Crispy coconut rice salad with fermented pork. Okay. This dish is probably hands down my favorite. It has great texture and flavor and every bite has me love it more and more. And it's not as bold/funky as some other dishes so this is a great one to share if not everyone has the same taste/love for strong flavors. \\n\\nFood (okay)\\n\\nHerb fish: Okay, for $8 you get a tiny bundle of fish that would fit into the palm of your hand. It is wayy too overpriced for what you get. And I thought it tasted okay. They added some shrimp paste or something so it gives it an even fisher flavor which I was not loving. \\n\\nSaku: Tapioca dumplings. I did actually like the taste of these. You get 8 balls for $8 which is not a bad deal. But they also kinda fall short flavorwise considering how bold everything else is.\",\n",

It had an odd taste to it -- not horrible but not great. I didn't finish it and I am not someone that leaves before I finish my drink.\\n\\nSeafood Fondue -- VERY CHEESY and the description didn't mention that it had tons of mushrooms in it. I am not a fan of mushrooms. The cheese on the top was good but the cheese that was mixed with the seafood (scallops, shrimp & crawfish) was very runny. Not like any other seafood fondue we have ever had before.\\n\\nKid's Cheeseburger -- the meat was very very dry. G said he preferred the school cafeteria's burger over what was on his plate. Frozen french fries were nothing special either.\\n\\nCombo Plate w/Grilled Shrimp, Salmon & Stuffed Shrimp -- grilled shrimp was bland and took 3 lemon wedges to give it a touch of flavor; salmon was okay but nothing special; stuffed shrimp was good but had a touch too much Old Bay Seaoning on it.\\n\\nCombo Plate w/Grilled Shrimp, Blackened Catfish & Stuffed Shrimp -- E says that his grilled shimp was like mine, he liked the stuffed shrimp and the catfish was okay.\\n\\nRed Beans & Rice (side dish) -- this did have good flavor and I enjoyed it\\nSteamed Brocoli -- nothing exciting\\n\\nJalapeno Hushpuppies -- I am pretty sure that someone forgot the jalapenos. These hushpuppies were bland. When I order something that has jalapeno in it, I expect a kick to it and these did not deliver at all.\\n\\nWe don't plan on going back again. Not sure if they were having a bad night in the kitchen or what but we weren't impressed and the customer service was okay but not enough to make us want to try it again.\",\n",

This place is STILL a definite must-eat if you are from Austin. \\n\\nI took away a star and gave it 4 stars because of the wait. If you decide to go around 6-8pm (any day of the week) be prepared for a WAIT! The line goes out the door, wraps around the building, and then some. The ordering/seating system is also a little confusing for first-timers, I can't even try and explain it, but be ready to be mildly confused if it's your first time there.\\n\\nI also only gave it 4-stars because I don't know if I can give it 5-stars since the four times I've eaten there I've eaten the exact same burger... now, is that a bad thing? No, I think it might say a lot for Hopdoddy's since I'm so in love with this burger I can't even try other burgers. GREEK BURGER is where it's at. I'm a fan of Greek food in general, and to combine Greek + Burger into one beautiful mash-up? Heavenly. \\n\\nSo I don't know if that gives me the right to properly review this place. I think the problem with this place is that each burger is so good in its own right, once you try one burger, you can't stop eating that same burger... my boyfriend did the same thing with the Terlingua. He got it the first time, and the next two times he went, the burger was just so good he couldn't even bother try any of the others!\\n\\nThe boyfriend is in love with the Kennemec (spelling?) fries. Me? I think they aight! Sometimes they're really salty, and sometimes they're just perfect. I think the herb-y stuff they sprinkle on the fries makes it really stand out from other fries at burger places. \\n\\nI suggest if you go here, you go at like 5-5:30PM to beat the rush. And try and go in a big group and have everyone get different burgers, that way you have the opportunity to take a bite into other burgers to try them out. Don't be like me... stuck with the same delicious burger each time I go... woe is me!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My friend recommended Mark at 10th street tattoo. She'd recently got her first tattoo and actually went back to get another one from him a few weeks later. I'd been to one shop before coming here and I didn't have a pleasant experience so I didn't end up getting anything done. I decided to give 10th street a try since my friend had a great experience. I called Mark on a Thurs so I could talk to him and let him know what I was interested in and to see his availibility for Friday. I told him the size and words I wanted, he said it was pretty straight forward. I also mentioned to him my trip to the beach in a little over 3 weeks and he said I'd be fine. \\n\\nAfter work on Friday I drove straight to 10th street. I showed Mark the pictures on my phone of the words and symbol and showed him the placement on my body. He said it was great and he could definitely do it and it wouldn't take long...like max 15 min. That was great for me because it being my first one and not knowing what to expect-- the quicker the better lol. I felt very comfortable here. \\n\\nBefore he started the tattoo, I was able to see exactly where it would be and how it would look to make sure it was the exact location. I decided to move it slightly. I'm glad I was able to preview it though...being that it's permanent and all. \\n\\nOnce I got in the chair I tried to relax. He told me to let him know if I needed him to stop or anything like that but reassured me I'd be okay. I'm glad someone thought I'd be okay because I wasn't sure I was going to be lol. We talked through the whole thing which caused me to be at ease. It didn't hurt nearly as bad as I thought-- actually it didn't really hurt at all. A few times it was uncomfortable but just something you'd grit your teeth over. He was done before I knew it. I went to look at the final product and was extremely happy. It was exactly what I'd been wanting for so many years. \\n\\nIf youre getting your first tattoo or a tattoo in general I fully recommend 10th street. They are great, everyone is nice. You can ask as many questions as you need and they'll answer them. The prices are very decent also.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"After my previous review I was contacted by the owner Christopher at the beginning of August. He told me how he wants to be a 5 star business and that satisfaction is supposed to be 100% guaranteed. And what he could do to make this review a better.\\nI gave him my phone number and email as the yelp app for iphone doesn't let you see messages. I got a call on August 6th by Lisa who I can't remember is a co owner or a manager. She explained to me that the arrangement my mom had ordered came in a bud vase so it may have just looked small and what could she do to help. Luckily she was able to find the transaction and upgraded to the next size. It was delivered on the 8th or 9th and was beautiful as said my gma.\\n\\nA few reasons why this isn't upgraded to a 5 star:\\n\\n1) The woman I got who answered before Lisa was named Mary. She was sort of rude and snooty. Not very professional even after I explained that I wrote a bad review and the owner was trying to contact me.\\n\\n2) After I talked to my mom I realized she did a phone order. When she chose the cheapest arrangement it was not detailed as to how it would come. My mom expected something like the mug my gma got the second time around. Not a small bud vase. I believe detailed communication is key for a satisfied customer and consumer when placing a phone order.\\n\\n3) I got a phone call on the day of delievery questioning if my gma was home. She is in a walker and hard of hearing. I asked Mary if he rang the doorbell and she said yes. After I called my gma and called back Mary she had said he left it with the neighbor. Umm Hello...how do you know the neighbor \\n      A) will give it to my gma\\n      B) keep it  and pretend nothing was delivered\\n  I know the delivery guy did not ring the doorbell. Before my gpa died years ago a special doorbell was installed and was made loud enough to here it no matter what basically. My gma with her walker got to the door and no one was there then had to open it again once the neighbor did show up.\\n\\nSo...Thank You Christopher & Lisa. Much appreciation goes out to you and your hard work and wanting to make things right!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My roommate and I have lived here since 2014 and have had many of the same issues that many of the other reviewers have left. We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice. Too bad the apartments aren't just as nice, but you get what you pay for. They know us in the leasing office and at corporate. I don't think it means anything though. My roommate and I have learned to make the best of our living situation and I have hope that things will get better.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Let me begin by saying, if I were to rate the food that we received, it would have been four stars.  The pasta dish was well executed, the lobster roll was well done, and the oysters were of course well presented and great.\\n\\nWhat landed this restaurant a one star review was the general operation of the place.  We came in at 9:00 and understand that it's a hour before close, but after a $200 dinner for two we don't expect to be rushed past a reasonable pace.  We ordered 12 oysters, 6 cherry stones, a bottle of rose and two entrees.  We never got our clams with the oysters.  I assumed they would come as a mid course, but our entrees arrived and they were forgotten about.  Since we didn't want to let our food die in the kitchen while we waited for our clams, we didn't say anything at the time.  Maybe the server just forgot and they wouldn't be on the check.  \\n\\nTowards the end of finishing our entrees, the cooks in the kitchen started loudly cleaning up, and using pungent chemicals.  They were just throwing every metal thing they could find into a metal receptacle on the floor.  Imagine how loud that would be when you are 4 feet away from it.  It didn't make for a very relaxing expierience, and certainly made us feel rushed, like they just wanted to get out of there.  On top of it they were using a strong smelling chemical to clean the fryer while there were guests in the restaurant.  The aroma of the boiling fryer did not complement out nice bottle of french rose.  \\n\\nWhen the check came my girlfriend was so disappointed with the expierience that I didn't want to make it worse by getting into a conversation about paying for the 6 clams we didn't get.  It's too bad that this night went this way, because we love the menu and open kitchen concept of B&G.  We will most likely not be returning, when there are so many other options like ICOB, and Select that do it right, and think about guest expierience.  All of the other restaurants in this group are great, and hope B&G can once live up to to Barbara's reputation at some point.  \\n\\nIn closing, it would be a good idea for a restaurant to have an email address that links to a manager on their site.  If that was available, this review would have went straight to the restaurants inbox, instead of being written for all to see.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Located behind the Pizza Hut on S Apopka Vineland Road sits the aged Sheraton Lake Buena Vista  Resort.  Upon arriving at the hotel, we noted the dated lobby matched the dated exterior of the hotel.  We thought we had jumped into a hot tub time machine and were transported back to the 80's.  We were greeted at the front desk by a friendly staff who informed us that the hotel would need a credit card for the $21.90 daily resort fee and $15 daily parking fee that would be assessed to the room.  The thought of paying a resort and parking fee to a hotel with a mammoth parking lot and a physical structure that was built before I was born seemed unfathomable to me but when you have children crying for Disney World all you can do is provide the front desk with a credit card.  \\n\\nWe then proceeded to our room in Building 3 which was between Building 2 and Building 4.  The hotel had 4 seperate buildings that formed a square around the two large pools and water slide.  As we exited the elevator and headed to our room on the fourth floor, we noted that the interior of the building had been renovated with new hallway carpet and paint down the walls.  Upon entering our room, we noted a small but newly renovated room with two queen size beds, and a balcony facing the mammoth parking lot.  The room did include some nice extras including an in room safe, mini refrigerator and new flat screen television.  They also included the Sheraton comfortable sleep beds which were a pleasure to crawl into after a long day at the Disney Parks.  \\n\\nAlthough we booked our reservation through a name your own price bid on Priceline, we were pleasantly surprised by the comfort of our stay.  As long as you can get past the shared parking lot with the Pizza Hut in front of the hotel and the extremely dated exterior and certain interior areas of the hotel, the Sheraton Lake Buena Vista is not a bad place to stay.  Of course, obtaining a reasonable rate is important as the hotel's daily resort and parking fees will be added to your bill.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I feel like I'm jumping on the Andrew McKinney bandwagon here, but for what it's worth, I have to throw in my two cents on having Andrew as my realtor.\\n\\nAndrew and I met in February 2014 for an introductory meeting. I appreciated the chance to sit down with him before making the decision that he was going to be my go-to guy for the home buying process. I appreciated his professional and positive attitude and his willingness to be patient with me as a first-time buyer who had lots of questions and not many definite answers about what I wanted.\\n\\nThroughout the next six or so months, Andrew was a regular fixture of my life as my weekends and thoughts became consumed with scouring the MLS listings, visiting open houses, and asking a million questions. We navigated the complex Boston real estate market and the emotional roller coaster of home buying including rejected offers (1), accepted offers with 'bad' inspections (2), and finally - and I mean FINALLY - the right property. \\n\\nAndrew was always available via e-mail, text, or phone for a quick chat. He accompanied me on various open house visits and every home inspection (3 by the time all was said and done). He even had a colleague meet me halfway through one loooong inspection when he had to leave to go to a closing for another client. And, importantly, he always was positive and encouraged me not to lose hope when I felt disappointed by the process. He also helped in highlighting potential properties on the MLS listing for me, visiting some properties and sharing thoughts with me when I wasn't able to attend, and was always willing to debrief about what I had toured and what I was thinking. As others have noted, Andrew also has strong relationships with other related professionals (financing, home inspectors, etc). It was helpful to have his personal weight in occasionally leveraging these relationships for a quicker turnaround time to keep my process moving forward.\\n\\nAndrew also had a great way of listening without interjecting. He was careful to let me, the buyer, make the decision of which neighborhood or property would work for me and didn't want his impressions to color my opinions. All in all, Andrew helped me tailor a seemingly endless search to a terrific condo that I feel so lucky to be in now. It's not an easy process but having Andrew as a realtor and ally made it easier.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My husband and I have done business with Beaverton Toyota 3 times and each time, they've blown me away at the service they've provided (I mean that in a good way). We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \\nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My favorite place to eat in Boston. Granted, I go here pretty regularly because it's so close to my school, but that doesn't take away from the plethora of high-quality options. Of all the reviews I have on Yelp, I would consider this review to be the most credible; I have ate almost every menu item this establishment offers. For appetizers, the onion rings are to die for. I've been to some pretty high end places that offer onion rings for twice the price (think Grille 23) and still don't live up to the flavor of the Parish onion rings. For wing enthusiasts, the Parish wings are also a must-try. They are a little expensive for the amount that you get, but these baked wings are an experience that every wing enthusiast needs to try with hearty helpings of the banana mango chutney sauce served on the side. The egg quesadilla is also delicious, but definitely more of a deep cut to be tried after you've been hooked to Parish. That's not an affront the dish, the wings and the onion rings are just that damn good! \\n\\nThe sandwiches are the reason I keep coming back here. There are very few sandwiches I haven't tried here and even less sandwiches I don't like. My personal favorite is the Mexican Meatball. If you can handle spicy, then you have to try this on your first visit. Props to you if you can finish that sandwich. The Parish Chicken Sandwich is very good, but a little overhyped. It's delicious, but not incredibly unique. The Egg Salad Lyonnaise is another favorite of mine, and recently at that. I had stayed away from this sandwich for the longest time, as I generally despise egg salad. If you're on the same boat as me in that respect, fear not! It doesn't have the usual overpowering mayonnaise and calling it an egg salad sandwich honestly isn't even an appropriate title. The Rialto is very good, if a little less than filling in my opinion. The Eggplant Milanese is an excellent option for vegetarians. It also accomplishes the rare feat of filling my stomach (something that vegetarian dishes generally don't do for me). \\n\\nHonestly, after I typed that sentence I realized that I was going to run down the whole menu and that is way too TLDR. In short, try everything! The only menu items I feel lukewarm about are the Chicken Herb Sandwich and the Spicy Tuna Burger. Not bad sandwiches, but honestly didn't leave that much of an impression. Fairly easy to get a table in short order here (even on weekends) and the beer menu is EXTENSIVE. Got to go, I've just convinced myself to go to Parish.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"BHOP is a 4.5. Yelp does not allow for 1/2 star ratings so i had to opt for 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars because as the law of contracts states when there is an ambiguity within the contract, it will be construed against the party who chose the construction of the contract. \\n\\nStraight to the point as to why I want to give BHOP above a four star rating: Their food is simply the bomb. Always tasty and delicious, their food never disappoints. I'm generally just a straight up Za and Hoagie guy from Pizza Shops. I usually will just stick to the main varieties of what someone would think of when they order from a shop like this Chicken fingers/wings, all sorts of Pizza including cheese when i want to keep the Za pure but will go from anything ranging pepperoni to sexy bacon and jalapeno. I will usually let burger joints stick to burgers IE Five Guys, Big n Tasty, Micky-dees. But BHOPS burgers are out of this world. Simply unreal. I can't forget about their Za either as the BBQ chicken pizza is mouth watering. You can't go wrong with a cheese Za either. But honestly, i can't stop thinking about their suprisingly amazing burgers. \\n\\nLet me tell you one thing about myself before i go further so you can understand the context of this post. I'm an average chiller who likes to play his share of xbox, watch boston sports, and go about my day to day business. One would say i'm an average bro that really appreciates a good bite to eat: burritos, pizza, chinese food, sushi, you name it. I like food. \\n\\nNow lets get to why i didn't give them 5 stars. BHOP deserves 5 stars for how good their food is but i simply cannot do it. They are consistently late with delivery and often forget items. Although I feel bad even saying it because their food is really good but I hope they read this so they can make their service better. Although i hate not getting a can of pepsi, or a missing slice of succulent bacon on da burger i ordered, or when my AMAZING spicy curly fries are not there, I can't hate on them too much because they deliver me delicious BBQ chicken pizza and burgers.  That being said, get it picked up and make sure they don't forget to give you your goods. \\n\\n\\nSincerely Yours,\\n\\nTeam Pizza\",\n",

       "  'text': \"We like joeys and do chose to come here.  The food is good But service can be hit and miss.  \\nMost recently we came early on a Friday night and didn't have much choice of tables but we made do.  \\n\\nOur waiter was very professional and on top of things.  We did not feel rushed and were left to enjoy cocktails and breaks between food. I had a Caesar which was good and spicy but just made with regular old clamato and there was nothing to make it different from any plain Caesar I make at home.  I want drinks to wow me when I'm out. The only thing I don't do is the bean - they are gross. Celery only please it is classic and not out of fashion like the bean( so,last decade). Plus it was in a short old fashioned glass which is completely wrong.  The bar seemed to be the worst thing here.  More later. \\n\\nLettuce wrap was delicious but small portion for the price. Panang  prawn curry was delicious as always and the fettuccine was very good but again a puny portion for the price and then They ask if you'd like the garlic bread with it but don't tell you it's an extra charge. \\n\\nAll in all the food is very good but really the menu is a bit tired.  I've been eating the same things there for 15 years.  And the interior while nice is again very old and tired- that glass sculpture is past its prime. \\n\\nFor dessert we had our favourite and really the best dessert anywhere - the key lime pie.  It is super amazing and HUGE.  There is no way one person could finish it unless you had it for your entree!!  We ordered Spanish coffees which at close to $8 each were the biggest clunker of the night.  I was actually shocked.  Instead of special coffee glasses with a sugared rim, tons of whipped cream and a cherry they were in two white dollar store coffee mugs, no sugar rim no cherry or garnish of any kind and just a spoonful of whipped cream,  they were really bad and again the fault of the bar. \\n\\nI think this location could use a Reno - it hasn't been done since it was Joey tomatoes.  The 60s scotch and steak house theme is really really done.  And maybe a menu update would be good. And a new bar manager for sure. \\n\\nFinally I thought Joeys tried to make itself unchildfriendly- well it didn't work- self centred twenty something's bring their kids in here in droves despite no kids menu, high chairs or change tables because it's where THEY want to go.  I listened to a crying a baby for 15 minutes.  Please go back to Whitespot until your kids are teens like we did.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This review is in regards to my experience with Oak + Fort's online website, more specifically, their Customer Care department. I can sum it up in one word: nonexistent. I purchased a gift voucher online as a gift for my bridesmaid back on August 31st. I would have purchased it in person at their downtown Vancouver location, but as I had been busy with my wedding and I had flown in from out of town that week, I simply did not have the time. I thought I had saved myself so much time and effort by purchasing a gift certificate online. I couldn't have been more wrong.\\n\\nThey only accepted PayPal for payment, which wasn't a problem. I received the receipt for my payment right away, but it wasn't until September 9th (more than a week later) that I received an email from a Stephanie from Customer Care confirming who she was to send the voucher to. I responded on the same day, requesting that she send the voucher to my email address so that I could then forward it to its recipient. I never heard from anyone again. I sent another email on September 12 (nothing), and on September 17th I told them that if I didn't hear from them by the end of the week, I would file a dispute with PayPal to get my money back. Throughout this time, I attempted to phone Customer Care (no one responded) to deal with this issue. I also made sure that the gift voucher did not get lost in my (and the gift card's recipient's) email spam folder. I finally got so fed up, I went ahead and filed a dispute with PayPal on September 20th. One week later, Oak + Fort had still not responded to the dispute, so I escalated the dispute to a claim to get my money back.\\n\\nIt's a shame I've had such a horrible experience with Oak + Fort because I really am a fan of their clothing and aesthetic, along with their sister company, Loft82. But for a company with a continuously growing online presence (Facebook, Instagram), it's  frankly pathetic how bad their customer service department is. I even tried writing on their Facebook page in the hopes that SOMEONE would see and respond. It's unbelievable that they have no problems updating their Instagram and Facebook accounts daily, but no one can even be bothered to respond to messages in their Customer Care department. Even more, for something as simple as purchasing an online gift card where it is to be received by email (and not even through regular mail), it's inexcusable that it's taken this long without a reply. It's been over a month, and as of today I still have not heard a single word from the company since September 9th. I will provide an update if I ever end up hearing from them to see how they handle the situation.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"So, myself and five friends decided to try the famous Wahlburgers. We were curious to see what all the rave was about. We were greeted at the door by a cordial young lady and she told us the name of our waitress and that she would be right over. She approached our table within a minute or so and introduced herself. She was very kind and a great waitress. I just wish I remember her name. We went in about 6:30 PM and at that time there were only a few other parties inside eating. \\n\\nWe ordered our burgers and I must admit that they were all cooked to perfection. They were on the bland side and nothing to brag about. I don't think they were flame broiled on a nice hot live flame...... too bad for us. We ordered tots and they were so-so. The onion rings were very good and sliced nice and thin and yes, they were crunchy. Five had sodas and one had tea. \\n\\nAs we tried to carry on a conversation, it was difficult to do so. The music was extra loud and we could not hear one another talking. Three times we asked for them to please turn it down. We had planned on having a dessert and coffee afterward but we just wanted to hurry up and get out of there because the atmosphere was not pleasant. This restaurant is definitely not geared for the over forty crowd. The music was not the type any of us would listen to. It made for a tense meal. Three finished their burgers and three did not. As for the tots and fries, most of those were left behind too. We quickly asked the waitress for the bill so we could leave. Trust me, none of our meals looked like the pictures do up above. \\n\\nWe went around the corner to another establishment and had dessert and coffee there. The ambiance was nice and the dinner music was soothing. Ahhhhh, so relaxing..... finally. We carried on great conversation with a lot of laughs. The place was half filled at this time. \\n\\nHonestly, the Wahlburgers are way over their heads. They have opened up too many restaurants all over the country and out of the country. Paul and the family are not on site to see how things are being run by outsiders. Right from the beginning from watching the show, Paul was spot on when he made it known that he not happy with the expansion of Wahlburgers. He was afraid the quality would slide and go down.... it did. \\n\\nWithin a decade or less, I am sure you will see some of their franchises closing. When the owner is not around to watch the day to day operation, you lack the hands on approach as family is missing and that isn't good. More isn't always better and that rule applies to Wahlburgers. \\n\\nIf I need a burger, I am better off going to Five Guys in the next town... Peabody, Massachusetts. Better food and half the price. \\n\\nSorry guys, I didn't want to do this. Don't build anymore of these places as nobody from your family knows what is going on.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The 2 stars are for great variety. I would have given 4 stars but removed 2 for a failure of integrity for a customer oriented business. I shop big, & very recently since October 2013 having moved to a location close to Moody Street, have started to shop here. I am a customer who LOATHES to return things, & almost never have had to do it. Once in 15 yrs shopping at Market Basket, once in 15 yrs at Whole Foods, both times because it was a wrong item that I had bought. Incident 1. Early on, I bought some snacks that had gone bad. I called them right away & When I went back there was a little fuss but the young boy who took it back admonished me & said that I should not do it again (so it was my fault!) Incident 2. A 'sweet' famous in my region has recently been made & sold here in the US. I had bought it earlier in NY & it was excellent. SO seeing them in this store, i bought two boxes - upon opening the first, we found it tasted awful & it had a weird after taste. Having had the earlier experience, i was hesitant but did bring it up with a guy at the cash counter. He said they don't take back sweets. It was sealed and frozen but OK, i got rid of it (not cheap). Incident 3 was in two parts, so bear with me - I asked for 6 samosas, (so the same man who had politely told me he would not take back the sweets), packed them & wrote the number 6 on the outside. Upon going home I found 5 samosas....so figured that I must have been mistaken that samosas are a dollar each.....& that 6 must have been the price (which would make it 1.25 each). However I was there on Wednesday this week & saw that the samosas were indeed 1.00 per samosa, so there was a mistake last time. Seeing the same 'friendly' person who had packed them last time, I told him that he had written 6 but I found only 5 inside. SO making a genial point of his generosity/openness - he said to me, Don't worry, I'll give you an extra samosa today, 'neither you nor I are going to benefit from $1.00, (loose translation)'. So he put them in & wrote 6 outside & reiterated that there were SEVEN inside. I came home & as it was tea time, my husband opened up the samosa bag to toast - Imagine our disbelief & feelings to see that he had only packed SIX. There were no 7 in there. \\n\\nI am only a single customer, but I am feel I am a trouble free, good & loyal customer who goes back to the same business for ever. For me, I like the small local store connections & try to build it wherever I live. They just weren't/aren't interested or  ready for a repeat customer like myself. I wish them well - they have some good & some great stuff - & I had to think it over a couple of days. But I can't do business if I am not treated right. So here I am looking for another shop.....\",\n",

       "  'text': \"We used this mover service from moving our household stuff from Seattle to Sunnyvale.\\nOur experience:\\n1. For the initial quote given to us, the person over the phone did not write down a major part of our items and therefore gave us what seemed to be a very good quote. We made the mistake of not checking the quote at any time until  the actual day of hte move. That is when we find out that our initial quote was not created correctly and teh value needs to go up by around $ 700. Not sure if this is a trick they play with every potential customer to gain new business.\\n\\n2. There was no problem during the actual packing of stuff and it happened fairly smoothly. We gave the movers a tip of $ 80 which was very wrong -you will find out why in the next few lines.\\n\\n3. Our stuff took a little longer than promised to arrive. Anyways, a 2 days delay is not that much of an issue so not deducting any points for this.\\n\\n4. When the truck arrived in our city, we were told that the truck could not move in to our residential area until we paid them a long haul fees of $ 500. The exact delivery address had been given to the movers at the time of order creation and not a single mention of this was made at the time. \\n\\n5. When the truck finally arrived in our area, we found that some of the boxes of other people marked as fragile were used as the base boxes for our  heavier stuff. We felt bad for the people who would have gotten their fragile items in a definitely undesirable state later on.\\n\\n6. The stuff finally arrived at home. There were scratches on one table making it basically unusable for display. However, the rest of the limited furniture we got with us (dining table, chairs, one couch, TV table, bed stands, 2 beds and 2 mattresses) came in an ok state.\\n\\n7. When we had unpacked every single thing, we found that one of my work laptops which I had put in to one of the boxes was missing. It was a tiny Toshiba laptop and was kept in a hard case suitcase which we forgot to lock. It was, however, between some clothes and not easily seen unless someone went through the stuff. So looks like someone opened the suitcase and had a quick rummage through the contents to find anything of value.\\n\\n8. A 'coke' piggybank that we had picked up from World of Coca Cola in Atlanta and contained change probably worth around $ 80 was missing from the boxes. Some of the boxes that arrived had tears in them so it looks like it was very easy to remove. \\n\\nWe did not find or disvoer any other missing items but we just might discover more as we miss a thing and dont find it anywhere.\\nOne of the persons who had come to deliver the items in to our new house here mentioned that his partner had a court visit that they needed to make in time. Certainly felt a little intimidated by this piece of information. However, because of the rather rude behavior of these guys and also the extra $ 500 we had paid for the 'long haul', we decided no to tip these guys a cent.\\nBottomline -spend more money on movers and don't use these operators.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I live in Orlando and I heard about the opening of this new restaurant in the Millenia Mall; I wanted to come here so bad since my husband and I are foodies but we hadn't had a chance.\\n\\nMy parents are visiting for the weekend and my mom is a sucker for The Cheesecake Factory.... we were actually heading that way when I thought of Earls and told them to give it a try... in hopes that it wouldn't disappoint us.\\n\\nWe got here for a little after lunch time, maybe close to 3.00pm, and it was empty for a new restaurant, but it could have been the day and the hour. They offer valet for $7.00, and even if you don't make use of it -which we didn't-, the valet guys were such gentlemen they opened the door for us. \\n\\nWe were greeted by two young ladies very excited about our first visit and the girl who sat us told us about the restaurant's concept and the art and decorations, including a full wall art made with Sharpie.\\n\\nThe restaurant from my first impression can be described as: Elegant and Upscale. The servers are wearing formal attires and most of the lady servers are in heals (don't really know how they do it). Very clean space and incredible and unique decoration (different colors, tables, lightning, and art).\\n\\nOur server's name was Brooke S, and she was such a sweetheart. She explained that Earls was a Canadian food chain and that the concept was variety... and sure thing you open the menu and you get anything from Japanese to Vietnamese, Indian, American, and more. Prices are decent for the portions you get. \\nOne thing I loved was that she brought waters before anything else. That's a great touch, not everybody does it and you always need some water.\\n\\nWe order the Tuna Poke with Wonton chips and the Garlic Fries as appetizers... that Tuna Poke IS A MUST! What a delicious twist to a poke! And the wonton chips.... oh my Lord! \\nThe fries were good but nothing to rave about.\\n\\nThen we proceeded to order a Chicken Caesar salad, the Half Rack of Ribs with the Cajun Chicken combo that came with potato salad and Cole slaw, and the Chicken Curry.\\nEverything was amazing, from presentation, smells, and taste. I was even impressed with the caesar salad since it's so basic, I wasn't expecting it to be so good. The ribs were falling of the bone, that potato salad was fresh and crisp, and the curry... simply amazing! It came with jasmine rice and naan bread. It was spicy enough but no overpowering.\\nOf course... at the end of our meal we couldn't pass on the sweet tooth, and we fell for the coconut cake. That one was a little disappointing, I didn't think the coconut was well paired with a lime mousse and strawberries, but it might be just me.\\n\\nAt checkout time, the server brought the POS over to us since they don't take the credit card from you and you do the tip and confirm total yourself in front of the server. I know this is a new thing as of 2017 restaurants are not supposed to handle customer credit cards, so it was nice to see it in action.\\n\\nI loved to see the teamwork in this place. We knew who our server was but anybody who walked by us would take dirty plates of the way, ask about out experience, and bring water to the table. \\n\\nAll of this being said... we're definitely coming back for more and to try the beverages selection which seems unique and exquisite.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Let me start out with that this Petco is not every Petco. I am a tourist from Ohio and was only in Georgia for a few days and the Petco I normally go too is fantastic with knowledgeable staff that take great care of their animals (not just the fuzzy ones but the scales and finned ones too). This is the opposite of that place. So I stopped by just to see what a pet store this far from home has to offer. I love reptiles and fish and it is fun to see what everyone has and my reptile room has room for new tanks if I see a good deal on a reptile I want. I went in excited and ended up horrified at what I saw and witnessed from staff. The tanks were old which isn't the staffs fault and not a big deal I have seen old tanks like this taken care of well and look nice but they clearly didn't care to care about these tanks, algae and cyanobacteria abound with some tanks having incompatible fish shoved together. The icing came when I was at salt water and overheard the employee telling two customers that the fish they were looking at were damsels and I happen to look and see two SAILFIN TANGS! Not everyone may know salt water fish but there is a big difference between a tang and a damsel with the tang growing way way bigger. So what does someone do who knows more and can save a fish from being put into an improper home and saving a fishkeeper who doesn't know better a heartache? Politely point out that those aren't damsels but sailfin tangs and that get much bigger than a damsel would. And what does the employee do you wonder? Admits they aren't sure, maybe ask why I say that so they can learn and see what I see? Nope! She starts arguing with me very rudely! Says they are clearly and definitely damsels! So this back and forth continues and it starts to get heated and I'm at the point of pulling out my phone to show her what a sailfin tang looks like she can't deny it any more but my boyfriend pulls me away. I go to cool off a bit by going to the reptiles and hope the customers at least listen to me, especially since I said how I have been doing salt water and fish in general for years. What do I find? Not many reptiles those who are there being cared for, barely. I see leopard geckos and say how cute they are and the girl caring for them says that are weird and pulls one from under the carpet (which is a natural behavior) and proceeds to not set it down nicely but just tosses it. It is a living being for goodness sakes! Treat the poor thing with some care, even if you personally don't like it! I go back over to fish getting more and more disgusted with this place to find those customer getting both of the 'damsels' when tangs are very aggressive with the same species of tang. The employee comes back and says that 'other customer' (me) was right they are tangs and not damsels. And admits then that she knows little to nothing about salt water. Then why argue with me when I say how long I have been keeping aquariums? Why be selling animals you know nothing about?! This store disgusts me and makes me appreciate the one back home where the employees care and try to be as knowledgeable as possible for the sake of the animals. Petco, pay your people more so maybe they will care, hire people who care, or train them better (or better yet all three!) because this is why you get a bad name.\",\n",

On our trip this time to the airport which usually costs between $32-$34 the driver charged us $38. When we questioned him about the higher price he adjusted the price to $34. I can only think that was an intentional attempt to over charge us. They should be offering discounts because their cars are so disgusting. In the future I will take Uber or Lyft.  When we travel to other cities in the US the cabs are clean and decent.  Atlanta Airport is an international hub to the rest of the world.

       "  'text': \"I am very disgusted by what I witnessed at Hooters.  Today I went to Hooters for lunch.  There were at least 15-20 people of Mexican decent that walked in to be seated.  I overheard a few of the waitresses talking saying they did not want to seat/serve them because they felt like they probably wouldn't get a good tip because they were Mexicans.  The group stood at the hostess stand for about 15 minutes before being seated.  They were seated and sat for another 15 minutes and no one still had not served them. Finally a manager went to their table and at that moment one of the young ladies from the group told him that they would just go somewhere else and get something to eat.  This was a blatant display of discrimination and what makes this even worse is that the waitresses that were discriminating against them were of African American decent and should be aware of the struggle and discrimination that we as black people have gone through in the past and is still going through today.  It hurt my heart to see this take place as you could see that half of the group did not understand what was going on.  This type of behavior should not be tolerated and Hooters need to do a better job at screening who they hire.  There needs to be diversity training held at this establishment,. I will be contacting corporate regarding this incident. No one should ever be treated that way no matter what color or nationality they are!!!\",\n",

Every table was littered with food, dishes, & other trash from the day.  There were huge dust bunnies under the slide and play ground equipment and other junk all over the floors (hair ties, paper pieces, a random sock, just other etc garbage all over the place).  The area for little ones under two is a joke, even for my 9mo old.  It is small with very little to offer, forcing is in to the bigger area where the real dirt and grime is.  Every little toy picked up has clearly not been cleaned in days, probably weeks or even months by the level of grime and stickiness involved.  Everything has a layer of filth covering it, from ride on & push toys, climbing thing, and the big balls.  Shall we talk about the bathroom?  A whole new level of gross.  The changing pad was a mixture of yellow, tan, & brown and no covers were available.  Shocker.  I packed up our things, bundled, and went to the neighboring store to 'shop' so I could use their clean restroom for myself and the diaper change.  \\nI don't know how this place is still open, and especially how it has so many stars on here.  It is a whole new level is disgusting, and not real impressive otherwise.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"In general I'm a HUGE Winners fan. I would however have to say that of all the locations here in Vancouver, this one is by far the worst (oh wait just saw a review for Metrotown Winners...perhaps I stand corrected). Either way, this location is surely no prize. Unfortunately this location is a block from my office so I rolled in last week with one thing on the brain 'Travel Coffee Mug', which I found about a half hour later after a few failed attempts. I was just disgusted by the state of the store. I mean I get that the traffic there must be ridiculous but the place was honestly in shambles, if you're getting the traffic, then you're getting the sales and should be able to employ enough people to keep your store from looking like a flop house. I dodged the crowds and headed to the teeny tiny home section at the back of the store and tried not to touch anything. Seriously I'm in no way a germophobe but this place was just a mess. I thought I might find something on the clearance rack but that just seemed to be a haven for broken merchandise. I didn't actually find anything I liked in the home section and dejectedly was making my way to the front to escape when low and behold I found my current travel mug on a display by the cash. Soooo... I ended up finding my mug and saving the $4 extra I would have paid for an alternative at Starbucks but seriously if I had a 'do-over' I would have happily paid said savings to have that half hour of my life back.... yuck.\",\n",

They told me 15 minutes and it wound up being a little more than that, no big deal. The set up is a little different than I was expecting their register is sort of half way in the back almost behind a curtain. I paid about $30 for everything. The crab Rangoon wasn't what I was expecting, it seemed like there was some kind of fish with egg. I've had crab Rangoon from Thai places before and it was still with cream cheese I'm thinking maybe they misheard me or I ordered the wrong thing ok no big deal. I open the salad and there is a big black hair on my avocado. Gross, I throw the avocado out and try to see if I can stomach the rest of the salad. It seems ok but after the hair not really feeling it. Move on to the drunken noodle and they just taste off to me. Too much fish sauce or something. Can't even eat it and I wind up throwing everything down the garbage disposal. Mango smoothie I drank while driving I'm not sure what o was expecting but there were all kinds of strange textures going on and after reading some of the other reviews I do not want to know what it was. I'm sad because I really wanted to like this place but I am grossed out and will not be going back.\",\n",

I'm not a picky coffee drinker, but I was only able to choke down one sip. My cousin ordered the soft scrambled eggs with mushrooms. He took one bite and left the rest because it was such an unappealing pile of snotty looking eggs. He is a 20 something year old guy who will eat literally anything, so the rest of us at the table had to take a bite to see what was so terrible about it.

When I got back to work I opened my wrap only to find that the tortilla was extremely burnt on the edges. I had to peel off the entire edge of the tortilla, the wrap was sloppy with stringy lettuce...YUCK!! I felt so grossed out because the stringy lettuce reminded me of her hair as it was going down and I felt sick. I threw it away. I paid $7.50 for this crappy food. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!! \\n\\nPS: Wish I didn't have to click on a star...NO STARS\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The Enormous Room is one of those places everyone should try because it's different than any other bar in Boston. What the Enormous Room does offer is something rare, but something people who are familiar with Chicago's nightlife can appreciate. \\n\\nIt's a lounge with a good DJ. It provides a semi-upscale, hip atmosphere for drinking, hanging out with friends and even dancing, but be sure to arrive early because the interior space resembles what would happen if a Miami nightclub and a hooka bar had a bastard child and to say seating is limited, is a gross understatement. \\n\\nThe deep, soft couches, pillows and overstuffed chairs lining the exposed brick walls make seating very limited. The only bar is really a window in the back of the club where waitstaff shuffle back and forth taking drink orders and generally creating poor traffic flow. \\n\\nMy recommendation would be to arrive early with a group of friends and claim a good space or for the more adventurous couple/date, grab a good spot and order some of the tasty appetizers and watch all the fresh Nike kids work on their break dancing routines.  I like this place but if you don't feel like standing around and waiting for drinks, then this probably isn't for you without prior planning.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Ok. Put a plate of greens and veggies in front of me and then a nice, healthy helping of incredible chicken salad and I'll be your best friend. Cafe at Pharr has some of the most simplistically executed recipes and iterations of chicken salad(s) that I've had, but they are so perfectly simple and delicious. \\n\\nCame in for lunch and started with a cup of the chicken noodle soup. It only comes in one size, just so you know you don't have to choose between a cup, bowl, jug, whatever. It was pretty textbook. Nothing too far out of the ordinary, weird, complicated, etc. It's just hearty chicken noodle, brosef. \\n\\nThen, the salad plate. Greens, carrots, grapes, tomatoes, and some of the tastiest curry chicken salad I've ever had. The chicken salad is so fine, but still retaining thickness, that it's spreadable. It's creamy, but not in a gross way like some chicken salads are -- AKA they don't go overboard with mayo. To add onto this flavor train, the dressing they give you on the side is rather magical. It's a semi-sweet, ginger dressing. I can't put my finger on the entire flavor profile, but it is perfect. I used it in moderation to not overpower any of the other flavors, but man they do it right. I can see that working on a multitude of dishes. \\n\\nI'm really digging Cafe at Pharr. It's a healthy choice and they do one of my favorite things perfectly. Well done, folks. Keep it coming.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"TL:DNR - Delivery sucks, food was cold and flavorless.\\n\\nDelivery:\\nWe flew into Boston and got in super late and found that this place was open until 3am! Score! We made the order through Yelp at 1:05am last night, thinking we'll have some awesome food to eat! We called to make sure that they received the order and was, indeed, delivering it. They told us 40 minutes. This was at 1:10am. \\n\\n2AM - No food. We call and they tell us that the guy left half an hour ago and should be there any minute. We call the third party ordering system 15 minutes later (2:15am) and ask them where's our order. We're starving. We haven't eaten real food (only plane snacks) since noon west coast time, since we've been on the plane the whole time, we were just hungry. They tell us to keep waiting. Our food finally shows up at 2:38am. They apologized and said it was very busy.\\n\\nFood:\\nYou'd think that because we were so hungry, we'd just think the food was delicious all around, right? No. It was not. The food was barely warm, and mostly closer to room temperature. We ordered the Taiwan Style Wonton Soup - the soup was flavorless, the noodles were mushy, but the wontons had decent flavor to them. The soup tasted like a watered down version of how the soup should be. We also got the beef fried rice, which was fine for fried rice. We also got the Panfried Pork Buns Shanghai Style, which was cold by the time we got it, so it was pretty gross. I can't speak to how it might taste when it's warm.\\n\\nI can't say that I can really update this review because I don't live in the area, but it did suck to hope for good food at the end of the night after a long flight only to be disappointed with a cold and flavorless meal. If you're ordering delivery, just be aware.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I accompanied my husband to Orlando for Cisco Live. We chose the Peabody due to its close proximity to the convention center (the most convenient location) and stayed here from a Sat to a Fri. We arrived extremely early on Saturday and luckily they had an available room for us. I wasn't a fan of the smaller room (and I'd be the one hanging out in it the most) so we upgraded a notch and got a larger room in the Mallard Tower. It was very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me! Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a/c not working so well, I didn't like the size/layout of the room. We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.\\n\\nShould I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.\\n\\nPeabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out. The parking structure is conveniently located a short walk from the hotel. It was faster and a bit cheaper to park this way.\",\n",

I was so excited to come back on Saturday and dig into a bucket of mussels. The appetizer I remembered had been just that: a big bucket full of mussels in a delicious sauce. This time the appetizer was a smallish bowl - the mussels were fresh, but I didn't LOVE the sauce. My friend and I split the crab cake sandwich as our main meal and it was pretty good - I think she may have liked it more than I did. \\n\\nThe service was fine (our waitress drew a cute little crab on our check haha) but I really hated the table she sat us at. The table was held up by thick bars and I just happen to hate sitting on stools. Also, the table had some pretty big gaps in it so I was neurotically worried that my drink was going to spill. Being uncomfortable and anxious can definitely put a damper on any meal. \\n\\nStill, I do love the atmosphere here. The Barking Crab really reminds me of some of my favorite seafood shacks in Long Island. I'm sure I'll come back again but I'm definitely more eager to now to explore some of the other seafood options Boston has to offer.\",\n",

Since I moved to Portland I was going to a chain store dental practice because I thought it was cheaper, which is definitely not the case, and I was treated as a number. In short, no one really cared.  I love this practice because it is just the opposite, and they have the perfect combination of professionalism and familiarity that I enjoy -as much as one can enjoy going to the dentist. You can tell that Dr. Daby and his staff work hard in making the experience of going to the dentist not only bearable, but somewhat pleasant. They take time to talk to you and explain you everything you want to know; from medical procedures to financing. Overall, I encourage anyone to give them a try. You won't be disappointed -and also, it's a great way to support local businesses -if that is something you care about as I do.\",\n",

I loved the decor (I wanted to steal the green chair in the living room up by the pastries).  The outdoor seating looked nice, and the basement was cool, but there was someone napping down there, which isn't particularly welcoming.  I had house coffee and a three seed bagel.  The bagel was pretty good and the coffee was delish, but having to squeeze my cream cheese out of a tube kind of sucks.  The barista was friendly, the prices were pretty average, and the selection of food items seemed decent for a coffee shop.\\n\\nI'm sure some people love the lighting, but I think that it was too dark and made the place a little dreary.  It's not really the venues fault, but I feel uncomfortable having a conversation with so many lone people working on laptops and such, but I am weirdly paranoid about eavesdropping; if it was a little busier this wouldn't have been an issue.\\n\\nThe restroom was reasonably clean, but the light switch is painted the same dark color as the walls and it took me a moment to find it.  And I really hate having to look for more than 10 seconds for a light switch!\",\n",

Our check in person was great- friendly & efficient. Next day? Different lady could hardly be bothered to help me. \\n\\nBack to the plus - we found the food here to be quite good. Stephanie , our breakfast hostess, was wonderful. Room service one night - we were pleasantly surprised by the prices & the quality of the food.\\n\\nThe room itself was a mixed bag. Very clean and we were facing the back, so it was quiet. The bed? Ugh. Memory foam topper on top of what is supposed to be a select comfort mattress. First off, we hate memory foam. Then, couldn't seem to get the mattress to adjust at all. Not comfortable sleeping for us.\\n\\nAlso, we couldn't get the AC / heating adjusted correctly. It would shut off at night & get very stuffy. The controls are older , in a console by the window instead of being controlled by a thermostat like many more updated Garden Inns.\\n\\nWe used points to stay here so it was fine for us.

All my friend and I could do was look at each other, roll our eyes, and wish we'd gone somewhere else. Tattoos, nose rings, and scroungy.

Most of the people in the place at the time were probably between 25-40 and what was blaring on the stereo? Rap music! They were obviously playing the music for themselves without any consideration for the people who were there at the time. I find that extremely annoying.\\n\\nI do like the bar seating along the windows though. That's probably the best thing about the place for me. Is it enough for me to want to go back. No way.

Yes, perhaps it is a little musty with all that partying history but that is not a reason not to go to The Emerald Supper Club. Rarely will you come across a place that is so retro, so cool.\\n\\nThe service was a little cool and so was my food, however. My BBQ Pork Waffle Fry Poutine was barely warm so I had to wolf it down before The Hard Rock Miners Singalong began. I totally loved the goat cheese dip with caramelized onions, super tasty and the homemade potato chips were super crisp. I can see why most people talk about the waffle fries. This place knows how to deep fry.\\n\\nDespite having some issues with the food, the music venue was fantastic (call ahead to make reservations if you want to be sure to see the band) and the setting so much fun. I don't think I have ever been to quite a fantastically retro place before.

I figure we should get here early as I hate waiting for food.  Anyways we got here and there were already half way full, usually a good sign. So the thing to remember here is, their menu changes daily. We were here on a Sunday I believe, there 3 choices for the ramen and 2 choices for the side orders. Chicken karaage and pot stickers. I read one of the reviewers raving about the pot stickers, so I decided to order it as well. This is how unmemorable this place was too me, as I write this review down I couldn't even for the love of me remember the type of ramen I ordered. I wasn't keen in eating anything spicy that early in the day so I opt out on the ramen that didn't offer any heat at all. We ordered at the counter and service was quick and friendly. I really wanted to like this place, but it was such a disappointment. The ramen, was just okay. I've definitely had better and for $10 bucks, I've expected more. The pot stickers were nothing impressive to what the other reviewer was raving about. Maybe, I'll return in a different day and see what their menu is like? Not really sure, if I want to spend my $$ here when I know I can find a way much better Ramen in Portland like UMAI!\",\n",

I understand the dishes are unique and it's not your average Indian place. The menu was great, had a hard time choosing what to get. Good selection of drinks. Quite dim inside, good fast service.\\n\\nI hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. \\n\\nTried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! \\n\\nOverall really good food and service. Wish I could choose the level of heat, make a reservation, and prices were slightly lower!\",\n",

It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\\n\\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\\n\\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.\",\n",

The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It's also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\\n\\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \\n\\nI believe I've made a great investment. I still can't believe I'm going to see this well FOREVER! :-) \\n\\nMy only complaint was that they didn't administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?) I didn't feel nervous before it started, but a little panic hit me when my eye was being held open and I was asked to keep my eye very still.\\n\\nOh, and they charge $2100 per eye for the all-laser lasik.\",\n",

I get it, most nail salons are like that but it makes me question if they are even licensed to be doing my nails. The language barrier leaves a lot of room for misunderstandings.\\n\\nSecondly, they were in a rush to leave so they did my manicure and pedicure simultaneously which was uncomfortable because they were trying to twist my body in uncomfortable ways. The lady doing my manicure was skipping steps (. I'm a licensed cosmetologist so I know how manicures are supposed to be done) she also couldn't understand my English when I politely corrected her. She was standing I front of the tv the whole time so I had no choice but to stare off into space. At one point the staff we're arguing with each other which made me very uneasy as I'm trying to relax. The straw that broke the camels back was when the manicurist was trying to rinse my hands in the water my feet had been soaking in. She didn't speak or give me direction, she just pulled my hands rather aggressively down towards my feet and cause me to accidentally kick my legs forward. My left fiit, which was submerged in the water, banged against the tub. My right root was getting worked on by the guy doing my pedicure and caused me to kick him. It was very awkward and embarrassing. I even passed gas. The other clients were staring because of the yelp I made when my toe got banged.\\nTwo days later, my toe has finally stopped throbbing.\\n\\nIt was not pleasant and it took them way too long to finish everything since they wasted so much time being in each other's way and arguing.\\n\\nIn the end I must say the older gentleman who did my pedicure was very polite and did an excellent job manicuring my feet from start to finish. I just wish his English was better.\\n\\nThe lady manicurist was horrible, impatient, messy and clearly didn't go to nail school.\\n\\nWhat a waste of $50.\",\n",

This is my indulgence late at night after work when everything else is closed.\\n\\nThe Breakdown:\\n\\n- Sweet baby soy sauce! Have you seen the hours for this place??? Open until TWO AM?!?! This is possibly the best thing about 888. I work until midnight, and the idea of fast food when I'm too lazy to cook is unappealing. More places should do this in Austin.\\n\\n- Clean, clean, clean! 888 is always spotless. No grime. No sticky tables. Restrooms (Ladies cuz I'm a LADY) are clean if a little run down.\\n\\n- SUPER polite staff. Even when they're in a rush, they're friendly.\\n\\n- The food. (This is gonna be a long one!) It's glorious. Generous proportions (which my fat self doesn't necessarily need), flavorful, beautifully plated. They know what they're doing. My two staples are the red curry with chicken and the General Tso's chicken. Curry is definitely one of their specialties. I thought I'd hate it, but it's soooo good (and I can't stand spicy stuff).\\n\\n- I'm not much for atmosphere, but it's always somewhat dimly lit and cozy. Good selection of ambient music, and just loud enough so people aren't listening to your conversation at the next table.\\n\\n- Excellent prices. I can get a meal for just about 10$ (more if I'm indulging in some appetizers *grin*).\\n\\n- Parking is ample, and oddly enough I don't necessarily feel unsafe despite the next-door-to-Riverside location.\\n\\n- Service can sometimes be a little slow. On more than one occasion it seemed to take a little too long for entrees to arrive when dining in. Not a deal breaker at all, but I could see some because frustrated with this. I generally order carry-out, and it's always ready in the 10ish minutes it takes me to get there.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line:\\n\\nWell above average food for average prices and super awesome late hours places this restaurant in my top 5 favorites in the Houston/Austin/San Antonio/DFW area. Highly recommended (srsly, get drunk and eat some curry).\",\n",

Its got the feel of a sports bar / pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. \\n\\nSecond, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. \\n\\nThird, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. \\n\\nfourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) \\n\\nThe burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. \\nConsidering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable!\\n\\nfinally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. \\n\\nAll around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but  two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!!\\n\\ngo Romer's!\",\n",

We  got to the restaurant at 6:20. No one came to offer us even menus or water  until  we Had been sitting  for about 35 min.  They had a large party on the other side of the restaurant. They were only paying attention to that side.  There were only two tables with patrons on this side of the restaurant.   There were people / staff standing around doing nothing initially and still did not come to ask us anything.  The music was so terribly loud from the party side  we could not  hear each other nor even converse with the waitress when she finally did come. Most of us developed headaches .We finally ordered and it took over an hour for the kids pasta to even come out. Close to the end we could not wait anymore. The kids were asleep on the bed/seating area. We had to get up and leave Before our dinner even arrived.  The waitress told me to go get some fresh air from outside.  And that the food should be ready soon.  it was 28° and raining, by the way.  Was she out of her mind!  1/2 of us left while the others waited for the food to come still... \\n\\nMy husband  stated that this is the most horrible dining experience has ever had',\n",

       "  'text': \"Wow! I'm surprised at how many people have such a lack of knowledge on what tastes good and what a good burrito is. Let me start by saying this is the second time I've been here. I really wanted to like this place coming from California, I love burritos and this place happens to be right in front of where I live. I didn't want to write a negative review after my first experience (which was horrible), so I decided to give it a second shot. First time I was here, I had the chicken burrito. It was so bland. If you're going to put rice and beans in all your burritos, make sure they're well seasoned. Their onions are just very huge sloppy chunks. I felt like I was just biting into onions. For my second visit, I decided to go with their popular pork and Chile burrito, chicken quesadilla, nachos with the meat chili and guacamole. Burrito was once again super bland. Half of it didn't even have any meat in it, I thought they accidentally made the vegetarian one. Once I got to the meat, it was once again flavorless... the nachos came out with no meat chili which I had to pay $4 something extra for (good thing I checked my box before I left). The quesadilla was super soggy and dripping with liquid. The guac was under seasoned and didn't even have cilantro in it. Just overall another horrible experience. Anyone who says this place is good, is not a good person to ask for food recommendations. You're better off going to Taco Bell.\",\n",

She put the table reservation under my name and hers so that we would be there to surprise him once they arrived. The lady (which I'm told is the owner's mom) told me several times my name was not on their list and there are no more tables available. They finally let me in to stand around like a sardine then I decided to ask someone else about our reservation who saw my name right away...by this time my friend who made the reservation and the birthday guy arrived outside and were told they had to wait in a very long line even though they paid $250 for a table...I went outside to get them and the old lady was very rude once again saying make them wait, I told her she doesn't have a table, etc...even though another worker at the establishment told her we were on the list...the lady continued to be rude and not only did she not let them in for another 20 minutes she didn't want to let me back in because she was wrong and had an attitude when I showed her my name on the list...she even went off on the employee for simply correcting her...to finally get in and seated was very stressful and the party scene just isn't worth the headache of dealing with the mom at the door.

My experience was worse than the last time! Doubletree apparently has really gone down hill...I will never stay at another Doubletree again. \\nThis particular location is a good walk to downtown where north market and the restaurants are so just be aware when making reservations.  We arrived and the parking situation is not that great, you share a public parking garage and it costs $22 per night with no valet. It's hard to get your luggage to and from the car due to the location of parking. You have to go up to the lobby and then another elevator to the main floors. I could live with that ..the issue was the cleanliness and the service. \\nThe king room was a very nice size but very dated and our room was not clean. Stains on the walls, bathroom was not clean , shower still had hair in it! \\nThe bar in the restaurant is fine, if you are lucky enough to get the good bartender otherwise you have someone that doesn't know the first thing about making a drink. Which leads me to the free breakfast from the restaurant. I was not expecting 5 star dining but again cleanliness and service horrible! The breakfast buffet was laid out with over cooked sausage and bacon, stale bread and bagels, eggs were never brought out. We sat down, lay  our napkins out and were appalled to have hair all over our napkins! As if that wasn't enough that evening our neighbors decided to have a party until 6 AM . We awoke to very loud yelling and laughing, etc. about 3 AM. We called down to the front desk continuously but no one ever did anything about it. These walls must be paper thin because it was as if they were in the same room with us! Sorry, will not be staying here again. I love Hilton properties but I am done with this one!\",\n",

I went back and asked the girl at the counter if our $5+ piece of cheesecake was supposed to be lemon and she said that it was supposed to taste as such.  I promptly let her know they should let folks know their cheesecake is lemon flavored before they waste over $5 on it and toss it in the trash.  Worst cheesecake I've ever had.  Horrible customer service.  DO NOT TRY THEIR CHEESECAKE!\",\n",

You may say, well kid that's pretty much normal anywhere you go on a busy night. But the fact is the place is not crowded at all. The entire design of the bar was horribly added into the space provided. It takes way too long to get a drink in here and you constantly have people on top of one another trying to get one. Then a big table is situated right in front of the bar, which limits people from getting to the bar. These are just some of the issues with the layout.

So, if you've tried it once and didn't like it, you should try again on a different night or make sure you spend time in each of the two rooms.  For example, on Fri & Sat, the backroom is usually host to a cover band with lots of college age patrons.  On Tuesday's, its open mike night in the back which is much more low key with often quite a bit of talent on display (along with some that are quite painful to watch).  \\nThe food is average pub fare, with both American and Irish favorites.  The beer selection is quite good, with many Irish beers and ciders offered.  The bar and wait staff is varied - I've had both wonderful and horrible (not attentive) service on differing nights.  \\nBut, this is all part of the personality of the Burren - its one of the few bars that actually has its own feel - not one that was manufactured and is being marketed to you (such as the Joshua Tree across the street from it).\",\n",

One of the corners is right next to a crowded doorway. Not only do you have to be mindful of people, the door itself is in the way. You essentially can't shoot from that corner of the table. An easy fix would be to take that door off entirely and just have an open doorway. \\nSecondly, the drinks are pretty watered down. I've ordered a drink at the bar on a weekend and with dinner on a weekday (the sliders are pretty good). Despite the bartender being incredibly friendly during dinner, I was questioning if there was even alcohol in my cocktail (maybe I'm just an alcoholic).

After about 15 minutes I got  his attention and asked about the sausage, his reply was that it should be coming.  After at least another 10 minutes he brought it and dropped it quickly on the table with no comment and left.  No management was ever seen.  Finally got the waiter's attention again, sent the sausage back and asked for our check.  That took time also.

After waiting for about 40 minutes we asked the host what was going on?  He explained to us people were not leaving etc.....he finally got us a couch to sit at while we proceeded to wait another 30 minutes for a table of 4. The service was so so poor.  Finally the host told us how sorry he was and he would give us complimentary dessert.  We felt better that as least they understood we had waited forever.  We sat and our server again apologized to us about how long we had to wait and reminded us about our free dessert more than once.  The food was sub-par to say the least.  The restaurant was SUPER loud because of the wedding going on next door and the bridal party kept running in and out of the restaurant getting drinks at the bar.  After we finished dinner we decided we would just order 2 desserts to spit between both couples.  When we ordered the two $6.00 desserts the waitress proceeded to tell us that we would only be getting one dessert free!  Needless to say, horrible customer service and not very bright wait staff, the least she could have done was go ask if they could comp our $12.00 worth of dessert that they had reminded is 4 time that we would be getting. Very upsetting and disappointing night.',\n",

I waited for about 10 minutes before the manager Chris came in and the first thing he said is we are not taking anymore customers. I said but my tire is going flat and needs repaired. again he said we are not taking anymore customers. Now there were other customers there and I realize they would come first, but all he had to say was i have people ahead of you but i will get your tire fixed since its going flat.( aka customer service).  Luckily there was a tire Kingdom around the corner and they were cleaning up and getting ready to close for the night. They said no problem we will fix it for you. They jumped right on it and fixed my tire which had a 4 inch bolt/screw  in it and they had to take the tire off the rim to fix it. They never once complained and were so much more professional. Come to find out they had a special and it only cost me 11.50 to fix it. I would not recommend going to Firestone in Orange City Florida. Their customer service is horrible and that is because of their Manager Chris. i will be calling corporate and making a complaint against This store and the Manager. I am also a retired Fire Fighter and  I know a lot of fireman and their family's in the Central Florida area that always need car work done. I will be spreading the word DO NOT go here. Take your business over to Tire Kingdom in Orange City where they treat you like a human being and are very Professional.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I've been to this location a couple of times, the service has never been great but I've come back for the good food. This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible. My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events. After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive, I ordered a cocktail that took about 15 minutes to arrive and it also took me asking (literally) 5 times to receive a glass of water. I'm pretty sure this was our server's first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things. We ordered 2 appetizers, the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip. The trout dip was tolerable, but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor. The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise. Then came the entrees... which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order. His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular. My barramuni was inedible. I don't know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry. Not only that, it was completely unseasoned, but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper. The fish was supposed to come with quinoa, squash and green beans. Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash. This wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't taken so long for our server to check on our dishes, and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner. Instead we had to yet again flag down our server, and then when he seemed confused about what to do, we had to ask him to send over the manager. Even after taking my entree off the bill I was furious to have spent $50 on such a disappointing experience.\",\n",

The one star is for their horribly rude service. \\n\\nI was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down/wrapping up/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it's not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there's no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There's no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn't familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it's not packed, there's echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually wasn't the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.\\n\\nPoint of the story is, I understand that it's end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i'm actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it's end of day and it's not because of their personalities), then don't say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM. BUT, with this experience I will NEVER buy from Yalla again.\",\n",

I'd read just about every yelp review for this place--I could probably recite the menu from front to back since I'd looked it up so many times. \\n\\nThe manfriend's dad is in the wine business and wanted to treat us with some awesome food so we were to meet him and his wife for a 7pm reservation. We were there at 6:30, and needless to say: it was PACKED. A lovely bartender saw us trying to avoid traffic and immediately asked if she could get us anything. Two glasses of pinot noir coming right up! The bartenders did an amazing job keeping track of the order people came in so they could point them to seats as soon as one cleared up.\\n\\nManfriend's Poppa and Momma bear came promptly at 6:45 to check in, only to find the reservation was at 7:30 pm. Momma bear promptly pulled up a voicemail they'd left with her earlier in the morning to show us they'd reminded her it was 7. We were all excited though and continued to dodge the waitstaff as we waited for our new reservation.\\n\\nOnce finally seated, we ordered the brie and calamari for the table. The brie was a much smaller portion than I expected and buried underneath a mountain of arugula. It was a nice attempt, but all the toppings and dressings washed out the brie. The calamari was delicious--perfectly crisped and battered. The bread of course was to die for. The manager even came by with a plate of bolognese to apologize for the mess up. This was AMAZING!\\n\\nAfter a bit of a wait (expected since it was crowded), our food came...and it just went downhill. Manfriend's sauce that the salmon sat in tasted like salsa. My medium-rare burger was actually well done. Momma bear's porkchop had a different side from the one she requested and was completely dried out. Poppa bear was also missing a side. We didn't bother waiting for corrections--we'd already been there for 2.5 hours just waiting from start till now. My burger probably would've been good, but I left half of it untouched. A well done burger just isn't a burger anymore. I ordered a drink instead....which also never came.\\n\\nI was so horribly disappointed by the end of the meal. It's hard to stay mad at the staff since they're actually VERY sweet, but they just didn't handle our dinner service well at all.\",\n",

    "### Question 1e\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's learn Mongo updates, deletions, and creation. Create a new collection called `review_boolean` which is the exact same as `reviews` EXCEPT there is a new field called `to_avoid` which is the string \"true\"  if the review `text` contains the words \"disgusting\", \"horrid\", \"horrible\", \"gross\", \"bad\", or \"hate\" and the string \"false\" if not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tricky task! We have not discussed creation, updates, or insertions in great detail during lecture but luckily, Mongo uses a similar approach to SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Insertions*: In order to insert into a document, you may use the functions [review_boolean.insert_one(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertOne/) or [review_boolean.insert_many(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/). These functions take in a document or a list of documents and inserts them into the collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Updates*: In order to update a document, you may use the functions [review_boolean.update_one(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateOne/) or [review_boolean.update_many(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateMany/). These functions take in two parameters. The first specifies which documents should be modified. If the first parameter is `{}`, this indicates that all documents should be updated. However, you can put a more specific filter here if you would like. The second parameter specifies what you would like to update your field to (the [$set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/set/) operator may come in handy here). Recall that in our SQL model, updates are performed as `UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...`. In our case, the first ellipsis corresponds to `review_boolean`, the second ellipsis corresponds to the second parameter of `update_*`, and the third ellipsis corresponds to the first parameter of `update_*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Creation*: We handle creation of the collection for you. But in Pymongo, creation of a collection is as simple as writing `variable_name = db[collection_name]` where db is the the Pymongo database object variable you have already created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional reminders and hints:\n",
    "- The empty collection `review_boolean` has already been created for you and is stored in the variable of the same name.\n",
    "- A text index has been created for you. You can use a similar search approach as the last question.\n",
    "- We want to start by inserting the documents from the `review` collection into the `review_boolean` collection.\n",
    "- Don't forget that in order to pass the hidden tests, the `to_avoid` field must exist for every document in `review_boolean`! The [$exists](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/exists/) operator may be helpful."

However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. <br><br>After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don&#x27;t offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. <br><br>Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don&#x27;t know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2014-10-11 03:34:02&quot;}</td>\n",

    "One important aspect of data engineering that we have not referred to yet are joins. We saw, through the use of indices, selection/projection pushdown, and various physical implementations (as well as orderings), joins could be done quite efficiently in relational SQL based databases. How do joins fare in Mongo where the data stored is inherently semistructured? Let's investigate! For this question, we have provided you access to the tables `business_complete` and `review_complete` which contain the business and review collections in relational form as described in 2b (the columns of the relations\n",

However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don&#x27;t offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don&#x27;t know the former glory to be able to compare.

Dataframes are similar to relations with some differences as we will dive into here. To that end, we will use Pandas which is a Python package that allows you to work with dataframes. Pandas is widely adopted by data scientists for data loading, wrangling, cleaning, and analysis. To start, let us export our MongoDB collections into Pandas using a function called `json_normalize`. We need to truncate\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous question, we talked about how Mongo and Postgres approach joins. Pandas is also capable of performing joins using the [merge()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) function! For this task, perform a inner join on `business_df` with itself on `stars`. The final dataframe should be saved to a variable called `result_3b` and should only contain 3 columns in this particular order: the name of the first restaurant, the name of the second restaurant, and the number of the stars. The column names can be arbitrary.\n",

If you experience issues with downloading via clicking on the link, you can also navigate to the project 4 directory within JupyterHub (remove `proj4.ipynb` from the url), and manually download the generated zip files.
